                <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Context </h2>
                <p class="copy">In this book, Greek literature professor SImon Goldhill explains several ways in which Greek and Roman culture have influenced present day society, in beauty standards, religion, politics and education. A lot of the content was over my head, since I realized while reading this I know next to nothing about Greek and Roman culture, but it was a fascinating window into how ancient customs still influence and control modern life.

                <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains the Greek concept of Eros, or desire, which was looked down on as something that <strong>“destroys and perverts all the yoked bonds of society.”</strong> (p49). He elaborates, <strong>“‘self-control’ is the most prized of virtues, and it means not desiring to desire. It also means controlling the unfortunate self as much as possible when and if the regrettable happens and unconquerable desire does strike. Severe and high-minded philosophers seek fulfillment in contemplation, self-control and deep thoughts. For less high-minded citizens, eros can at least be satisfied by a particular physical fulfillment. Eros does not last, or rather it is not meant to last.It can be transferred serially and easily to another object of desire. Consummated eros is satisfied and finished, whereas love is for ever.”</strong> (p49).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill contrasts the beginnings of Christianity with mainstream Greek and Roman culture, <strong>“Christians admired the ‘anchorite’ who lives as a hermit, completely on his own, in a cell or cave, removed from human society. Sexual abstinence, a vow of silence, turning eyes to heaven, a regime of prayer, a commitment to fasting, are all ways of destroying the social links between humans. Even Socrates, the most self-controlled Greek philosopher, hangs out at the gym, drinks at the symposium and lies under the blanket with Alcibiades. The Christian Holy Man is exemplary by refusing these social bonds, these shared pleasures.”</strong> (p107).        
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>Christianity also made saints out of men and women who rejected the bonds of human society in a passionate attempt to forge a singular relationship with God. This construction of the holiness of separation based on an intense inwardness, remains integral to Christian theology. Christianity is founded on the inversion of what were essential signs of Graeco-Roman culture.”</strong>“ (p108).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The calendar for ordinary Christians might alternate fast and feast, Lent and Easter. But the ascetic followed an unbroken pattern of deprivation. As he strove and starved for spirituality, the body became ‘purified,’ purges of its own fleshliness. By fasting, he hoped, in the words of St Anthony, to ‘receive a portion of that spiritual body which it is to assume in the resurrection of the just.’ For a thousand years or more, a Christian couldn’t, shouldn’t be fat. Fat might be a political issue for the classical Athenian: for the Christian it was a religious issue that imperiled your immortal soul.”</strong> (p109). <em>Why are we obsessed with skinniness and the emaciated body? Is it our obsession with control? By rejecting the most basic needs of the body, we gain a sense of power and superiority? Some proof of our 'non-animalness?'</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Christianity invented Christian man by reversing the most cherished ideas of self-representation in Greece and Rome. It took the deliberately humiliating and painful punishment of a non-citizen – crucifixion – and made it a symbol of the triumph of a new order.”</strong> (p112). <em>Christianity was a counterculture that became mainstream? Was it the opposite of everything Greece and Roman on purpose, or because it was created by outsiders who already didn’t fit in the norms of mainstream society.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The philosopher Diogenes the Cynic lived in a barrel. He discarded all superfluous material things, and kepy only a loincloth and a drinking bowl – and when he saw a shepherd boy drink from a river with his hands, he threw away the bowl too. The word ‘Cynic’ means literally ‘like a dog,’ which refers at one level to the way of life of a Cynic – on the street, scavenging, without regard for social norms. In another sense it refers to their ‘biting’ wit.”</strong> (p135). <em>This is hilarious that even back then there was critique of materialism.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“One of the standard images of the philosopher is the man who can dismiss the cares of the world as trivial and superficial. Cynics, laughing and scorning, mocked those who cared about money, status, fine possessions, positions of power. The Stoics taught how to be stoical – not to be moved by such temporary and unimportant pleasures. A good Stoic would rather die than accept a corrupt life  – and would die happily.”</strong> (p137). <em>How have humans always been the same?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“True happiness comes not from fulfilled needs of pleasure but from lack of want.”</strong> (p138). <em>This is true, but not wanting anything can lead to a very boring, meaningless life.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains that the concepts of democracy, and distributed local government in which the public was involved began in Greece. He then writes about the criticism this model faced at the time. <strong>“In the Republic, Plato goes on to dissect ‘the democratic subject’ with acid wit. He recognizes that the freedom and liberalness of democracy are attractive, ‘like gaily coloured things are to woman and children’. But the democrat, he argues, can’t see that there are good and bad pleasures: ‘he shakes his head and says all pleasures are equal and should have equal rights.’ So, one day it’s wine, women and song, the next, a faddish diet. One day, it’s study, the next, physical sports. ‘There is no order or restraint in his life, and he reckons his way of life is pleasant, free and happy.’ Democracy’s freedom means social and psychological lack of control. When ‘anything goes’, proper order cannot be maintained.”</strong> (p199). <em>Exhibit now. When it's everyone's baby, it's no one's baby.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Socrates insisted that the unexamined life is not worth living.”</strong> (p206).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains gladiatorial games, in which hundreds of Athenians would fight to the death for spectators. He writes, <strong>“they were designed to be overwhelming, unique and monumental. They were hugely expensive and constructed to assert the total power of the emperor, a public and aggressive declaration of his control over the material world.”</strong> (p234).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains how gladiator games would end with the lone victor facing the emperor, who would decide whether to kill or spare him while spectators screamed their input, illustrating that <strong>“even those who do not kill want to have the power to do so.”</strong> (p243). <em>Vicarious power is almost as good as the real thing.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains the Greek Enlightenment, a time when folk medicine and knowledge became formalized into ‘disciplines.’ He elaborates, <strong>“for the first time in the fifth century there were recognized experts, trained in school, who engaged in self-conscious discussion of technique and principle, and debated the physical cause of disease, and experimented, and tested their results, and published their findings.” (p311). “This development of self-conscious, theoretical, abstract thought, along with new institutions of education and regulation, makes ‘medicine’ and ‘political philosophy’ disciplines for the first time.”</strong> (p312). <em>And we just rolled with that until now?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill explains that the discipline of studying history came from the Greek Enlightenment, especially Herodotus, the <strong>“father of history”</strong> (p312) who aimed to understand past events to better understand current cultural conditions. <strong>“[Herodotus asks us to] think hard about where events come from, and what makes us who we are.”</strong> (p315). Later, <strong>“Thucydides [claims], there is an intellectual duty to commit yourself to the truth – which means precision, accuracy and testability. He demands scientific history – history that sets itself to dispel myth. Critical analysis of the past is also a lesson from classical antiquity. Part of cultural tradition is the dissection and analysis of the past, and a drive towards self-awareness – towards an active recognition of one’s place in ongoing history.”</strong> (p315). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The most radical figures in politics, art, music, poetry, thought and sexual behaviour have taken classics as a moving force of their idealism.”</strong> (p319). <em>How did humans just peak in Greece and we never really advanced from there? I guess our brains just haven’t changed? This is just how humans are?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">“<strong>The person who does not understand the deep grounding of culture can only be a shallow person.”</strong> (p320).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Goldhill stresses the importance of understanding the past in order to question the present assumptions. He cites Cicero, <strong>“If you do not know where you come from, you will always be a child.”</strong> (p321). <em>If you do not know where things come from, you assume they are natural and right. You don't have the ammunition to question them. Realizing that culture is the rolling inheritance of customs dead people made up is being released from the confines to its rules.</em>
