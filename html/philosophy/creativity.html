            <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Context </h2>
            <p class="copy"> Published in 1979, this is a beautifully written collection of poetic essays on
                personhood,
                nature and the development of society by physician, educator, researcher, etymologist and poet Lewis
                Thomas.
                In it he brings a biological perspective to the issues of modern society, as well as examining the
                roots and
                development of the words, customs and beliefs we take for granted today. It helped me realize I do
                not know
                enough about the wonders of the natural world.</p>

            <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

            <p class="copy">L.M Terman defines intelligence: <strong>“the sine qua non of genius is the ability to acquire and to manipulate concepts, the shorthand symbols without which abstract thinking cannot proceed.”</strong> (p25). <em>Does it have to be abstract?</em></p>

            <p class="copy"> <strong>“The genius who survives as such has successfully run the gauntlet of premature death, the inanities of formal education, the social and ethical pressures of his immediate environment, and the more general cultural influences that have given direction and content to the civilization in which he was born.” </strong>(p26)
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Terman notes that IQ tests are not predictive of eminence, a finding from a study of 300 of the ‘most eminent individuals’ (selected from a list of Cattell’s 1000) by Catharine Cox. In her study, Cox examined the biographies of the individuals to deduce the minimum IQ of each individual, and the reliability of the estimate. Terman explains Cox’s conclusion that <strong>“those who do achieve greatly are characterized not only by superior intellectual ability but also ‘by persistence of motive and effort, confidence in their abilities and great strength or force of character.’” </strong>(p29) <em>Effort is giftedness.</em>
                Terman also relays German psychologist Lange-Eichbaum’s theory that <strong>“inner conflicts and tensions of whatever kind [are] stimulants to great achievement.”</strong> and that <strong>“without such irritants no one ever puts forth his maximum effort; that the person happily adjusted to its environment and never stirred to action by opposition or frustration is fordoomed to obscurity.”</strong> (p34)
                </strong></p>
