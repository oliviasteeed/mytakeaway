                <p class="copy">This is a collection of writings on creativity from psychologists and other creative
                    professionals published in 1970 ranging from empirical studies, subjective accounts and development
                    and
                    growth of the skill. Some are dense, some are fascinating and I’m sure some are out of date, but it
                    gives an expansive introduction to the investigation of creativity as a simultaneously innate and
                    experience-dependent trait.

                <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                <p class="copy">L.M Terman defines intelligence: <strong>“the sine qua non of genius is the ability to
                        acquire and to manipulate concepts, the shorthand symbols without which abstract thinking cannot
                        proceed.”</strong> (p25). <em>Does it have to be abstract?</em></p>

                <p class="copy"> <strong>“The genius who survives as such has successfully run the gauntlet of premature
                        death, the inanities of formal education, the social and ethical pressures of his immediate
                        environment, and the more general cultural influences that have given direction and content to
                        the
                        civilization in which he was born.” </strong>(p26)
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Terman notes that IQ tests are not predictive of eminence, a finding from a study of 300
                    of
                    the ‘most eminent individuals’ (selected from a list of Cattell’s 1000) by Catharine Cox. In her
                    study,
                    Cox examined the biographies of the individuals to deduce the minimum IQ of each individual, and the
                    reliability of the estimate. Terman explains Cox’s conclusion that <strong>“those who do achieve
                        greatly
                        are characterized not only by superior intellectual ability but also ‘by persistence of motive
                        and
                        effort, confidence in their abilities and great strength or force of character.’” </strong>(p29)
                    <em>Effort is giftedness.</em>
                    Terman also relays German psychologist Lange-Eichbaum’s theory that <strong>“inner conflicts and
                        tensions of whatever kind [are] stimulants to great achievement.”</strong> and that
                    <strong>“without
                        such irritants no one ever puts forth his maximum effort; that the person happily adjusted to
                        its
                        environment and never stirred to action by opposition or frustration is fordoomed to
                        obscurity.”</strong> (p34)
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">From an excerpt of a letter composed by Tchaikovsky: <strong>“if that condition of mind
                        and soul, which we call inspiration, lasted long without intermission, no artist could survive
                        it.” </strong>(p58).<em>The nature of being an artist is a manic swing from exclusively
                        absorbing the world to essentially ignoring it in favour of creative production.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Poet Stephen Spender explains the need for a steady stimulus to stay concentrated when
                    working creatively, giving the example of De la Mare needed to chainsmoke, or Schiller and the smell
                    of rotten apples. He explains, <strong>“there is always a slight tendency of the body go sabotage
                        the attention of the mind by providing some distraction. If this need for distraction can be
                        directed into one channel - such as the odor of rotten apples or the taste of tobacco or tea -
                        then other distractions outside oneself are put out of competition.”</strong> (p63). <em>This is
                        an interesting explanation for why I like listening to ASMR while working on assignments. One
                        assumes the clear desk in the room without interruptions is where most work will get done, but
                        in reality this allows the mind to wander freely. A steady stimulus distracts you from being
                        distracted.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Spender also asserts <strong>“it is evident that a faith in their vocation, mystical in
                        intensity, sustains poets.”</strong> (p73). <em>This applies equally to songwriting. Every time
                        I write a new song I feel like I’ve caught something, or channeled it for an hour and then it’s
                        let out into the creative product until I can trap it again.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Spender notes that eminent creatives sacrifice ‘normal’ aspects of life for the time and
                    energy to sustain creative production. He notes <strong>“a man of action does one thing or several
                        things because he does not do something else. Usually men who do very spectacular things fail
                        completely to do the ordinary things which fill the lives of most normal people and which would
                        be far more heroic and spectacular perhaps if they did not happen to be done by so many
                        people.”</strong> He ends this passage with a heartbreakingly relatable sentiment: <strong>“thus
                        in practice the life of action has always seemed to me an act of cutting oneself off from
                        life.</strong> (p73). <em>But you don’t have a choice, do you?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Poincaré in a discussion of mathematical creativity explains that new ideas and
                    realizations require an initial amount of familiarization with the problem and solution attempts,
                    and then a break to allow the unconscious mind to continue considering alternatives. He notes
                    <strong>“all the combinations would be formed in consequence of the automatism of the subliminal
                        self, but only the interesting ones would break into the domain of consciousness.”</strong>
                    (p85). He compares this to physical stimuli in which <strong>“only the most intense fix our
                        attention”</strong> especially those which <strong>“directly or indirectly, affect most
                        profoundly our emotional sensibility.”</strong> (p85). <em>We are kind of like computers running
                        every possible option, but slower and fuzzier, and we only notice when it makes us feel
                        something.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">German physicist Helmholtz used a stage model to explain the creative process,
                    consisting of Preparation, where <strong>“the problem is investigated in all directions,”</strong>
                    (p91) Incubation, where one is <strong>“not consciously thinking about the problem,”</strong> (p91)
                    and Illumination, when what G. Wallas calls the <strong>“happy idea”</strong> (p92) appears. Wallas
                    adds the fourth stage of Verification, where the idea is validated as relevant and accurate.
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Wallas mentions the importance of education <strong>“men have known for thousands of
                        years that conscious effort and its resulting habits can be used to improve the thought
                        processes of young persons, and have formulated for that purpose an elaborate art of education.
                        The ‘educated’ man can, in consequence, ‘put his mind on’ to a chosen subject, and ‘turn his
                        mind off’ in a way which is impossible to an uneducated man. The educated man has also acquired,
                        by the effort of observation and memorizing, a body of remembered facts and words which gives
                        him a wider range in the final moment of association, as well as a number of those habitual
                        tracks of association which constitute ‘thought systems.’"</strong> (p92-93). <em>Is
                        intelligence just mental control? How can we have none of this innately, when education was at
                        one point developed by uneducated people? Passing on knowledge to the next generation evolved
                        into formalized education and the mind molded around it until that became part of being
                        human.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Wallas mentions that to produce quality results, one must engage early in the
                    Preparation phase, to ensure there is enough Incubation time. He gives the example of
                    <strong>“practicing barristers [putting] off any consideration of each brief to the latest possible
                        moment before they have to deal with it, and [forgetting] the whole matter as rapidly as
                        possible after dealing with it. This fact may help to explain a certain want of depth which has
                        often been noticed in the typical lawyer-statesman, and which may be due to his conscious
                        thought not being sufficiently extended and enriched by subconscious thought.”</strong> (p94).
                    <em>Consciousness isn’t enough to be insightful.</em></p>

                <p class="copy">Wallas cites William James’ assertion that <strong>“when the conclusion is there, we
                        have always forgotten most of the steps preceding its attainment”</strong> (p97) in his
                    discussion of why the creative process remains nebulous at best.
                </p>

                <p class="copy">F. C. Bartlett, in an examination of scientific experimentation and creativity, explains
                    that <strong>“the most important feature of original experimental thinking is the discovery of
                        overlap where formerly only isolation and difference were recognized.”</strong> (p101). <em>I
                        think this is where intelligence comes from.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Bartlett goes on to explain that <strong>“especially in the early stages of specific
                        experimental progress, some of the most important thinking of the experimental scientists
                        concerns the pinpointing, of siting, of problems; this may do more than anything else to save
                        the experimenter from losing himself in detail.”</strong> (p104). <em>This feels relevant to
                        design too, as most things do to me. You can’t know when you’ve created something of value
                        without a deep understanding of the missing link you are trying to connect. And is it even a
                        link at all, or a separate chain entirely?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">E. W. Sinnott claims that humans have transcended other animals, as evidenced by the
                    fact that <strong>“most of his goals are now fulfilled not by bodily actions, but by mental
                        ones.”</strong> (p107). <em>Essentially, we’ve transcended literal reality, and live in
                        abstraction now. In parallel, one’s inner environment changes to reflect the increasing
                        complexity of modern life, and one’s outer environment becomes evermore complex as a result.
                        Sometimes I miss reality though.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Sinnott claims that the ability to learn alone is not enough to <strong>“make him truly
                        man. Another gift was necessary - the great gift of imagination. This is perhaps man’s most
                        distinctive trait, for it makes possible his creativeness.”</strong> (p108).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Poet A. E. Housman describes the creative impulses experienced in between mundane life
                    as follows. <strong>“As I went along, thinking of nothing in particular, only looking at things
                        around me and following the progress of the seasons, there would flow into my mind, with sudden
                        and unaccountable emotion, sometimes a line or two of verse, sometimes a whole stanza at once,
                        accompanied, not preceded, by a vague notion of the poem which they were destined to form part
                        of. Then there would usually be a lull of an hour or so, the perhaps the spring would bubble up
                        again.”</strong> (p109). <em>This is exactly how songwriting is, lyrics just arrive and you take
                        the ride or you let them pass. Interesting that this also alludes to the incubation phase but
                        between bouts of creative ideation. Do we owe creativity to the unconscious? Or maybe the
                        awareness that there is an unconscious is what makes us uniquely creative.</em></p>

                <p class="copy">Sinnott describes artists: <strong>“it has been found among all sorts of men and women
                        who are faced with the need - sometimes the consuming, passionate desire - to gain a new insight
                        into truth or beauty, to solve a problem in science, to bring to life a painting out of pigment,
                        oil and canvas, or to set a poem down in words. Such inspirations, it is well recognized, rarely
                        come unless an individual has immersed himself in a subject.”</strong> (p110). <em>If expertise
                        is a prerequisite for creativity, then generative AI will likely not make us ‘more creative’ as
                        optimists say, as we will lose grasp on the hard skills of executing creative concepts.
                        Expertise is a knowledge of what is possible, and what potential can be pursued, but is it
                        foundational to creativity? Can you truly be ‘creative’ if you do not understand what has come
                        before?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Sinnott describes how fully conscious, intentional acts of creativity are often
                    extremely difficult and of poorer quality than ‘organic’ creative formations. He notes <strong>“the
                        reason that such a frontal attack often fails seems to be that the free association, present in
                        the unconscious, is blocked in various ways and the really creative new relationships therefore
                        are not seen.”</strong> (p112). <em>We inhibit ourselves with the schema we have created to
                        understand.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Sinnot suggests that creativity is an inevitable byproduct of being a conscious human,
                    calling it an <strong>“attribute of life.”</strong> (p112). He goes on to explain that <strong>“mind
                        has a truly morphogenetic quality about it.”</strong> (p112), implying that we cannot help but
                    to make new connections. The unconscious mind yearns to understand and to express, which manifests
                    through creative production that the conscious mind can harness and execute. Sinnott closes with the
                    strong statement <strong>“imagination, we might say, is simply the basic formative quality of
                        life.”</strong> (p114).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">A. J. Cropley, in an examination of stimulus-response (S-R) theories of creativity,
                    cites Mednick’s theory that creativity is <strong>“the formation of associations between stimuli and
                        responses which are characterized by the fact that the elements linked together are not normally
                        associated. Thus, he suggests that divergent people tend to link stimuli with highly unlikely
                        responses, whereas in most people any particular stimulus is usually linked with the response
                        with which it has most frequently been paired. In other words, highly divergent people are
                        particularly skillful at linking together, in an effective way, aspects of their environment
                        which, on the basis of experience, do not really belong together.”</strong> (p117). <em>So
                        creativity is finding new combinations that belong together.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Cropley also mentions that creativity may be a function of instrumental condition,
                    wherein rewarded responses are repeated and neutral responses are not. He notes <strong>“the extent
                        to which a child is able to make creative responses will be heavily dependent on the extent to
                        which he has been rewarded or punished for creative thinking during his past
                        childhood.”</strong> (p118). <em>It’s kind of scary how most of the dimensions of the self are
                        largely experience-dependent. I wonder if rewarding creativity is enough to increase thoughtful
                        creativeness, or just fosters disruptive and attention-seeking ‘creativity’ that is more of a
                        refusal to conform than a desire to expand.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Cropley explains that creative people have a differing cognitive approach (he calls it a
                    <strong>“mind style”</strong> (p119) or <strong>“cognitive style”</strong> (p122)), in that they
                    take in more information from their environment, <strong>“rather than restricting themselves to a
                        narrow, but safe, segment of it.”</strong> (p119). <em>This is an underrated truth: creativity
                        requires fuel. In isolation I don’t think you can be creative, you need to take in the ambiguous
                        mess of external stimuli in order to create order and meaning out of it. Allowing oneself to
                        experience ambiguity is a hurdle that prevents a lot of people from being creative. Too many
                        people stop themself before they even start.</em> Cropley suggests further that there are two
                    general cognitive styles, one to selectively focus on a few elements of the environment, and one to
                    take in the world <strong>“in large lumps”</strong> (p122), and that creative thinkers are usually
                    those whose cognitive style <strong>“involves the least censoring of information.”</strong> (p123).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Cropley explains Bruner’s view of intelligence as data coding by linking novel stimuli
                    to past experiences in order to create a continuous thread of meaning. He explains <strong>“any
                        individual in contact with the external world is confronted with masses of data, too much, in
                        fact, for him to handle. If he tries to take in everything, he suffers a great deal of
                        ‘cognitive strain.’ What happens is that individual environmental events are tied to previous
                        events so that new data are seen, not as unique occurrences, but as part of a related sequence
                        of events which the environment has been providing throughout life. Thus, a new datum is
                        rendered ‘meaningful’ by being connected with past data which it resembles… The point is that
                        the external world is rendered meaningful by the linking of new events with past events which
                        they resemble, and Bruner sees this as the chief kind of intellectual activity.”</strong>
                    (p120). The categories within which we classify events are based on experience, so are generally
                    shared within cultures, yet some people classify in atypical ways, which we call creative thinking.
                    This involves <strong>“willingness to treat data whose connexion is not immediately apparent as
                        roughly equivalent”</strong> (p121), essentially embracing ambiguity until connection can be
                    inferred or imposed with novel categories.

                        report that the problem is simply insoluble when it becomes apparent that logic, rule, and
                        principle will not provide a solution. The latter kind of thinkers may even refuse to go on, on
                        the grounds that the situation is ‘foolish.’”</strong> (p123). <em>All of our limits are made

                        creative writer does the same as the child at play. He creates a world of phantasy which he
                        takes very seriously.”</strong> (p127). </p>

                <p class="copy">Freud explains that people stop playing as they mature, but they continue to yearn for
                    the pleasure of play, as <strong>“hardly anything is harder for a man than to give up a pleasure
                        which he has once experienced. Actually, we can never give anything up; we only exchange one
                        thing for another.”</strong> (p128). <em>I guess this is why we cannot solve climate

                <p class="copy">Freud claims that adults all secretly engage in fantasies of an ideal future using the
                    conditions of the present and experience of the past, stating <strong>“the wish makes use of an
                        occasion in the present to construct, on the pattern of the past, a picture of the
                        future.”</strong> (p130).

                <p class="copy">Freud explains the comfort of following a fictional heroic character with the comfort
                    that they are invincible, stating <strong>“as one of our best writers has expressed in an inimitable
                        phrase: ‘Nothing can happen to me!’ It seems to me, however, that through this revealing
                        characteristic of invulnerability we can immediately recognize His Majesty the Ego, the hero
                        alike of every day-dream and of every story.”</strong> (p132). <em>‘everybody wants to fall in
                        love, everybody wants to play the lead’</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Freud views the process of creative production as an expression of past and present
                    experiences. He suggests <strong>“a strong experience in the present awakens in the creative writer
                        a memory of an earlier experience (usually belonging to his childhood) from which there now
                        proceeds a wish which finds its fulfillment in the creative work. The work itself exhibits
                        elements of the recent provoking occasion as well as of the old memory.”</strong> (p133).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Previously, Freud mentioned how everyone has fantasies, yet we keep them hidden in
                    shame. He expands on this, claiming that for creatives <strong>“the essential ars poetica lies in
                        the technique of overcoming this feeling of repulsion in us which is undoubtedly connected with
                        the barriers that rise between each single ego and the others.”</strong> (p134). <em>This is the
                        reality of being an artist: it feels kind of gross and self-indulgent a lot of the time. This is
                        why I don’t paint anymore, because why? Why in a world of visual pollution would anyone need
                        another visual artifact? It’s a shameful paralysis. I keep making creative work of some capacity
                        because despite how icky it makes me feel at times, and how much I am well aware the world does
                        not need it, I have no choice.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The artist is an incipient introvert who is not far from being neurotic. He is
                        impelled by too powerful instinctive needs. He wants to achieve honour, power, riches, fame, and
                        the love of women, But he lacks the means of achieving these satisfactions. So unlike any other
                        unsatisfied person, he turns away from reality, and transfers all his interests, his libido,
                        too, to the elaboration of his imaginary wishes, all of which might easily point the way to
                        neurosis.”</strong> (Freud, obviously, p135). <em>Me with university.</em>

                <p class="copy">C. R. Rogers explains the need for creativity in a society that all but demands
                    conformity, <strong>“with scientific discovery and invention proceeding, we are told, at a geometric
                        rate of progression, a generally passive and culture-bound people cannot cope with the
                        multiplying issues and problems. Unless individualis, groups and nations can imagine, construct
                        and creatively revise new ways of relating to these complex changes, the lights will go out.
                        Unless man can make new and original adaptations to his environment as rapidly as his science
                        can change the environment, our culture will perish. Not only individual maladjustment and group
                        tensions but international annihilation will be the price we pay for lack of
                        creativity.”</strong> (p138). <em>And now AI is speeding up everything more to the point that

                        better? Did we not make up the world as it is in its current state? Why do we insist on making
                        life harder for ourselves when a fundamental tenet of humanity is we struggle with change? Are
                        there limits to our cognitive capacity worth respecting for the preservation of wellbeing? When

                <p class="copy">Rogers redeems himself with a very inclusive view of creativity, <strong>“the action of

                        these are, in terms of our definition, creative, and there is no attempt to set them in some
                        order of more or less creative.”</strong> (p140).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The mainspring of creativity appears to be the same tendency which we discover

                        may be seen as obvious, something self-evident to all. Only still later does it receive its
                        final evaluation as a creative contribution.”</strong> (Rogers, p141).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“It has been found that when the individual is ‘open’ to all of his experiences,
                        then his behaviour will be creative, and his creativity may be trusted to be essentially
                        constructive… To the extent that the individual is denying to awareness (or repressing, if you
                        prefer that term) large areas of his experience, then his creative formings may be pathological
                        or socially evil, or both.”</strong> (Rogers, p141).

                <p class="copy">Rogers explains that experiencing one’s surroundings without distorting them into
                    categories from perception is an important prerequisite to creativity. He elaborates,
                    <strong>“instead of perceiving in predetermined categories (trees are green; college education is
                        good; modern art is silly) the individual is aware of this existential moment as it is, this
                        being alive to many experiences which fall outside the usual categories (this tree is lavender;
                        this college education is damaging; this modern sculpture has a powerful effect on me).” He
                        reaffirms “the complete openness of awareness to what exists at this moment is, I believe, an
                        important condition of constructive creativity.”</strong> (p143). <em>I think we forgot to
                        experience our life. I wonder if meditation makes you more creative? It seems like practice
                        being completely open.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“I do not believe that many significant creative products are formed without the
                        feeling, ‘I am alone. No one has ever done just this before. I have ventured into territory

                        has also been a creeping disease in modern industry, where men and women need to perform less
                        and less like human beings. Their work no longer calls upon them, as formerly, for decisions and
                        constructive thinking. The advances in automation have not helped the situation. There is also
                        boredom arising from increased leisure time. Fortunately, satiation with any condition usually
                        leads to corrective measures. The best solution would seem to direct leisure-time activities
                        into channels of creative effort, giving individuals a taste of the rewards that can come from
                        such efforts.”</strong> (p168). <em>Freeing up all of our time to do what? Feel like we have no
                        skills, no purpose and no contribution? Now we have to carefully engage in ‘leisure creativity’

                        different directions, if not a necessity to do so in order to achieve an excellent performance.
                        Convergent-thinking activities proceed toward one right answer, or one that is more or less

                        the fathers’ occupational status is described as ‘university teaching, researching or editing.’
                        Among the ‘creative’ group, about 50 per cent of the fathers appear to have been engaged in
                        ‘business’ – nearly three times as many as the ‘intelligent’ group. The parents of the
                        ‘intelligent’ group exercised greater ‘critical vigilance’ in regard to their children’s
                        day-to-day life.”</strong> (p207). <em>Is business the only place creativity has left to

                <p class="copy">Hudson explains MacKinnon’s study on adult IQ and achievement, between which, beyond the
                    threshold of about 120 IQ, there is no relationship. He elaborates <strong>“above a certain required
                        minimum level of intelligence, which varies from field to field and in some instances may be
                        surprisingly low, being more intelligent does not guarantee a corresponding increase in
                        creativeness.”</strong> (p221). He later asserts <strong>“above a certain level of I.Q.,
                        motivation is of over-riding importance.”</strong> (p223) and cites Cox’s remark <strong>“high
                        but not the highest intelligence, combines with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve
                        greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less
                        persistence.”</strong> (p226).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Hudson, in his chapter, explains the results of a survey of eminent individuals with a
                    variety of creative careers (psychologists, novelists, physical scientists etc…). He explains that
                    assessing high-performing individuals, especially in sciences, with standardized IQ tests is
                    pointless because their skills greatly exceed those that the test expects or demands. He notes that
                    the complex skills of a scientist are <strong>“not beyond us simply because they are too complex.
                        They depend, firstly, on huge accumulations of experience; and secondly, upon the fact that the
                        individual concerned cares intensely about what he is doing. Without training and experience,
                        these complex skills do not exist.”</strong> (p226). <em>What is intelligence if such complex
                        and seemingly unattainable skills can be learned? IQ tests are more a measure of the public
                        school system or one’s enrichment experiences than the actual intelligence they possess, because
                        there is nothing tangible to examine. The brain is plastic, and its neurons are always changing
                        depending on what we do and don’t do. To think we are ever static is a myth. Therefore, is
                        intelligence a worthwhile ‘metric’ to measure? Isn’t the true asset motivation? From motivation
                        comes all other desirable traits.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Of the physical scientist, the very worst that one can say is that he is a
                        robot: he turns his back on a wide range of human experience more or less completely. Of the
                        novelist, that he is an emotional prostitute, a man retailing the events of his own private life
                        to please his public, or for money. The psychologist, on the other hand, does something
                        considerably more odd: he tries to make sense of human behaviour by reifying it. People are
                        described as though they are mechanisms; their experiences are reduced to numbers. He may even
                        make a virtue of discussing humans as if they were rats. The physical scientist denies his
                        emotions; the novelist exploits; the psychologist dismantles. Whatever the moral, it is not that

                <p class="copy">Hudson cites Roe’s finding that <strong>“it is likely that the kind of person who has
                        gone into social science may have had a biasing effect on the theories produced by social
                        scientists… Practically all current psychological theory of development stresses strongly the
                        central importance in any life of the richness of personal relations as the basis for
                        ‘adjustment.’ But the data of this study demonstrate, and it seems to me quite conclusively,
                        that a more than adequate personal and social adjustment in the larger sense of an adjustment
                        which permits a socially extremely useful life and one that is personally deeply satisfying, is
                        not only possible, but probably quite common, with little of the sort of personal relations
                        which psychologists consider essential. Many of the biological and physical scientists are very
                        little concerned with personal relations, and this is not only entirely satisfactory to them,
                        but it cannot be shown always to be a compensatory mechanism.”</strong> (p230). <em>I cannot
                        believe I never considered how biased all the scientific information we consider fact is by
                        those that are drawn to the field. If all the people deeply concerned with human behaviour and
                        connection become psychologists, then that becomes what is true of all humans. Literally nothing
                        is true then.</em>

                        stagnation. Is it better to be content and not living up to your potential, or miserable but

                <p class="copy">M. A. Wallach and N. Kogan explain that creativity requires <strong>“the production of
                        associative content that is abundant and that is unique”</strong> and <strong>“the presence in
                        the associator of a playful, permissive task attitude.”</strong> (p238).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Wallach and Kogan found in a study of school-aged children’s creativity in relation to
                    other personality traits, that girls high in creativity and intelligence <strong>“show the least
                        doubt and hesitation in all the groups, show the highest level of self-confidence, and display
                        the least tendency toward depreciation of oneself and one’s work… These girls are sought out by
                        their peers more eagerly than is any other group, and this high intelligence, high creativity
                        group also seeks the companionship of others more actively than does any other group.”</strong>
                    (p244). <em>It’s good to be on top.</em> In contrast, the high intelligence, low creativity group
                    was more insecure and anxious, in that they are <strong>“so attuned to error that even where
                        appropriate responses are not sacrificed, they refuse to deviate from a critical standard of
                        ‘correctness.’”</strong> (p251).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">High creativity and intelligence children are also more sensitive, and Wallach and Kogan
                    theorize, <strong>“the creativity and intelligence both could contribute to such physiognomic
                        sensitivity – responsiveness to ‘inner’ feeling states on the basis of perceivable externals –
                        suggested that two processes could be jointly involved in the display of sensitivity.”</strong>
                    (p252). <em>I wonder if HSPs are more creative or if sensitivity, meaning one is more aware of their
                        surroundings, leads to more creativity? What is the direction of causation here?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“It is unrealistic to assume that the most creative children are the happiest
                        children. There may well be elements of obsessiveness present in the kind of associative freedom
                        that leads to high creativity status. A playful contemplation of the possible, but also an
                        obsessive, task-centered reluctance to put a problem aside may be involved in the production of
                        many associates and of a large number of unique associates. Creativity need not be all sweetness
                        and light, therefore, but may well involve a tolerance for and understanding of sadness and
                        pain. To think otherwise is to fall prey to the rather widespread American stereotype that
                        suffering is always a bad thing and to be avoided at all costs.”</strong> (p253).

                <p class="copy">R. J. Shapiro cites Bruner’s definition of creativity, <strong>"‘an act that produced
                        effective surprise – this I shall take as the hallmark of a creative enterprise.’</strong> and
                    McPherson’s analysis of this, <strong>“The effective surprise is not produced because a product is
                        rare of bizarre, but because it has a quality of obviousness which results in a shock of
                        recognition.”</strong> (p261). <em>This is also a definition of good design.</em>

                <p class="copy">F. Barron explains that organizations and societies foster creativity when they are less
                    prescriptive and controlling of citizens, comparing totalitarian states to neurotic individuals. He
                    explains, <strong>“suppression is a common way of achieving unity, however, because in the short run
                        it often seems to work. Increasing complexity puts a strain upon the organism’s ability to
                        integrate phenomena; one solution of the difficulty is to inhibit the level of a greater level
                        of complexity, and thus to avoid the temporary disintegration that would otherwise have
                        resulted. Originality, then, flourishes when suppression is at a minimum.”</strong> (p286).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Barron suggests one of the requisite traits for creativity is ‘dominance,’ or <strong>“a
                        strong need for personal mastery, not merely over other persons, but over all of
                        experience.”</strong> (p287). <em>Creativity is ordering chaos in newly obvious ways.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The original person, in adulthood, thus often like things messy, at least at
                        first; the tendency is toward a final order, but the necessary preliminary is as big a mess as
                        possible.”</strong> (p287). <em>This is exactly EXACTLY the design process. I do not understand
                        designers that use autolayout from the start and delete all their drafts. When I start
                        designing, my entire goal is to create chaos, because from there the ideas emerge. Yes, at the
                        end it will be pixel perfect, but anyone can do that. The ideation process is what we, as
                        designers, have to offer.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“[Creatives] are characteristically aroused to wrath at the shoddy, the

                        endeavor, is itself the creation of a cosmos of their own, as though each mind is progressively
                        unfolding itself as life itself has.”</strong> (Barron, p288). <em>This is a stunningly

                <p class="copy">MacKinnon explains the results from a study of architects in relation to creativity,
                    noting that the most creative architects <strong>“appear to have both a strong need and superior

                        of sexual identifications and interests, out creative subjects appear to give more expression to
                        the feminine side of their nature than do less creative persons.”</strong> (p306).

                <p class="copy">R. B. Cattell and H. J. Butcher share the findings from a study of eminent scientists in
                    relation to creativity, in which they found the creative scientists has <strong>“uncongenial and
                        ‘undemocratic’ attitudes, associated with dominance… accounting to a belief that most people are

                <p class="copy">Cattell and Butcher found that creative scientists were all low on extraversion scores,
                    using Broadbent’s information to brain action theory that <strong>“as long as you use a lot of the
                        [sensory] channels for input, you have too few free channels for scanning… The typical extravert
                        conceivably has too many channels taking in information – or at least, alert to the external
                        trivia of everyday life – and not enough for scanning accepted material. Or to quote Wordsworth
                        instead of information theory: ‘The world is too much with us.’ And if we paraphrase the next
                        line,: ‘Talking and visiting, we lay waste to our powers.’”</strong> (p319). <em>Balancing the
                        innate need for social interaction with the burning desire to personally achieve is a challenge
                        for sure. Every second I spend socializing I am wasting time I could be spending producing. On
                        the other hand, spending my life in pursuit of achievement and nothing else (as I had for the
                        past 3 years) led to the most vacuous feeling of emptiness I’d ever experienced. I think you
                        need both to make life worth living.</em>

                <p class="copy">S. J. Parnes cites Guilford to explain how creativity is not a fixed metric, but an
                    experience-dependent and flexible trait (like everything else) <strong>“creative activity probably
                        represents to some extent many learned skills. There may be limitations set on these skills by
                        heredity; but I am convinced that through learning one can extend the skills beyond those
                        limitations.”</strong> (p434).

                <p class="copy">Parnes describes a university course on creativity in which students are taught
                    <strong>“deferred judgment”</strong> which is <strong>“deliberate separation of idea production from
                        evaluation. In other words, during the effort to generate ideas, the judicial process is
                        deliberately suspended; evaluation is deferred in order to allow full play to
                        imagination.”</strong> (p344). <em>Hey it’s Enzo Mari’s railway model of design(?). In order to
                        create anything of use and novelty one must allow the ‘poetics’ to breathe instead of forcing a
                        concept into pragmatic practice too soon.</em> He mentions an exercise in which students are
                    taught to consider unconventional uses for everyday objects to increase ideational fluency. Parnes
                    elaborates, <strong>“for example, in considering other uses for such an object as a piece of paper,
                        students are taught to look at each attribute of the paper – its whiteness, its four corners,
                        its straight edges, etc. Each of these attributes suggests a number of possible uses.”</strong>
                    (p345). <em>This is a good brainstorming exercise.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">In the course, students are also taught to solve problems in terms of asking questions.
                    Parnes emphasizes three key points stressed in the course: <strong>“the importance of taking notes,”
                        “the value of setting deadlines and quotas for production of ideas and the advantage of setting
                        aside certain times and places for deliberate idea production.”</strong> (p345).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Parnes explains that throughout the course, the principle of deferred judgment is
                    practiced through problem solving. Students are encouraged to first analyze, in which they list
                    every fact they have relating to the problem, then choose the most relevant to focus on. The
                    students <strong>“create the longest possible list of questions and sources of additional data that
                        could be useful”</strong> and select from these the most useful again. To evaluate their
                    options, <strong>“students are taught to develop the longest possible list of criteria by which to
                        evaluate their tentative solutions”</strong> (p346) and from these, you guessed it, they choose
                    the most relevant to compare against. The course was shown to facilitate a lasting increase in
                    creativity. Parnes notes Osborn’s theory that <strong>“in idea production, quality leads to
                        quality.”</strong> and Gordon’s idea of ‘deferment’ as <strong>“the capacity to discard the
                        glittering immediate in favor of a shadowy but possibly richer future.”</strong> (p349).
                    <em>Creativity is really about freeing yourself from the expectation of getting it right the first
                        time. It is letting yourself try and be imperfect. It is letting out the ready-made concepts to
                        make room for the truly novel to emerge. It is magic. It cannot be rushed.</em>

                <p class="copy">Parnes notes Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, atop of which is the need for self
                    actualization, the prime motivation of a healthy individual (Maslow views not having a tier of needs
                    met as being ‘sick’). Parnes cites Maslow <strong>“what a man can be, he must be.”</strong> (Maslow,
                    p351). <em>Yes. If there’s potential I have to reach it. I owe it to the universe.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The individual’s creative ability is frequently so repressed by his education
                        and experience that he cannot even recognize his full potential, let alone realize it. Once he
                        can be helped to do so, he can reach what Maslow calls ‘self-actualization.’ Education can do
                        much to help the individual achieve this fullest self-realization, whatever his level of native
                        capacity. Many people seem to possess the seeds of creativeness, but the environment fails to
                        provide the proper nourishment for growth. Therefore, these persons never fully live.”</strong>
                    (p352).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">E.P. Torrance explains how creative talent <strong>“has not been valued and rewarded in
                        our education system, so guidance workers have seem little reason to identify it and to try to
                        contribute to its growth.”</strong> (p356). <em>What education values, society becomes.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance further notes the importance of creative expression <strong>“the stifling of
                        creativity cuts at the very roots of satisfaction with living and ultimately creates
                        overwhelming tension and breakdown. There is little doubt that one’s creativity is his most
                        valuable resource in coping with life’s daily stresses.”</strong> (p356). Torrance continues,
                    <strong>“I suspect that schizophrenics and others who ‘break down’ under stress constitute one of
                        the most unimaginative, noncreative groups to be found. I also suspect that it was their lack of
                        creativity rather than its presence which brought about their breakdowns.”</strong> (p356-357).
                    <em>This kind of makes sense, creativity makes you flexible and resilient. If you are thwarted from
                        reaching your goal do you adjust or do you crumble? I'm worried about us as a species.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance explains the inadequacy of IQ tests in identifying highly achieving students,
                    <strong>“if we were to identify children as gifted on the basis of intelligence tests, we would
                        eliminate from consideration approximately 70 per cent of the most creative. This percentage
                        seems to hold fairly well no matter what educational level we study, from kindergarten through
                        graduate school.”</strong> (p358).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance mentions that high IQ students are preferred by teachers over highly creative
                    students, yet <strong>“the highly creative child appears to learn as much as the highly intelligent
                        one, at least in some schools, without appearing to work as hard. My guess is that these highly
                        creative children are learning and thinking when they appear to be ‘playing around.’... They
                        enjoy learning and thinking, and this looks like play rather than work.”</strong> (p359).
                    <em>Interesting that enjoying or having fun in school is looked down upon as something that needs to
                        be stopped.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Instead of trying to cram a lot of facts into the minds of children and make
                        them scientific encyclopedias, we must ask what kind of children they are becoming. What kind of
                        thinking do they do? How resourceful are they? Are they becoming more responsible? Are they
                        learning to give thoughtful explanations of the things they do and see? Do they believe their
                        own ideas to be of value? Can they share ideas and opinions with others? Do they relate similar
                        experiences together in order to draw conclusions? Do they do some thinking for
                        themselves?”</strong> (Torrance, p360).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance cites Harvard psychologist Henry Murray, <strong>“An emotional deficiency
                        disease, a paralysis of the creative imagination, an addiction to superficials – this is the
                        diagnosis I would offer to account for the greater part of the widespread desperation of our
                        time. Paralysis of the imagination, I suspect, would also account, in part, for the fact that
                        the great majority of us, wedded to comfort as long as we both shall live, are turning our eyes
                        away from the one thing we should be looking at: the possibility or probability of
                        co-extermination.”</strong> (p361).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance notes that typically highly creative students are <strong>“estranged”</strong>
                    from teachers and peers alike, and to support them to flourish. He explains, <strong>“the highly
                        creative child, adolescent or adult needs encouragement. He needs help in becoming reconciled
                        and, as Hughes Mearns (1941) once wrote, in being ‘made cheerful over the world’s stubborn
                        satisfaction in its own follies.’ The guidance worker must recognize, however, that this
                        estrangement exists and that he will have to create a relationship in which the creative
                        individuals feel safe.”</strong> (p362). <em>If creativity is allowing oneself to be open to all
                        of experience, and not suppressing the aversive, is a necessary outcome being a bit sad about
                        the world? Or a bit out of it? I feel like I’m floating out somewhere a lot of the time and
                        occasionally social connection pulls me back to Earth.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“A high degree of sensitivity, a capacity to be disturbed and divergent thinking
                        are essentials of the creative personality. Frequently, creative children are puzzled by their
                        own behaviour. They desperately need help in understanding themselves, particularly their
                        divergence.”</strong> (p364).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Torrance stressed the importance of educational and home environments to foster
                    creativity. He elaborates on the experience-dependence of creativity, <strong>“everyone possessed to
                        some degree the ability involved in being creative, that these abilities can be increased or
                        decreased by the way children are treated and that it is a legitimate function of the home and
                        the school to provide the experiences and guidance which will free them to function fully.” He
                        then notes the adverse effects of the school system on destroying children’s confidence and
                        ability to be creative, “I have seen many indications in out testing of first and second graders
                        that many children with impoverished imaginations have been subjected to rather vigorous and
                        stern efforts to eliminate fantasy too early. They are afraid to think.”</strong> (p367). <em>I
                        think everybody is creative, and creative adults are just the lucky ones that made it out alive.
                        Creativity is not just abstract and artsy, it allows us to solve problems and adapt. Without
                        creativity you are stuck, desperately searching for the one right answer. Creatives know there
                        is no ‘answer’ and the world is multidimensional and complicated and overwhelming and beautiful.
                        Creativity is confidence. Creativity is achieving yourself. I think the best thing you can do
                        for someone is give them the space and support to be themself fully, or in other words, to be
                        creative.</em>
