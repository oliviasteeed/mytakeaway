                    <p class="copy">First published in 1956 by professor of logic A.J. Ayer, this book is a survey of philosophical views on reality, experience and the self. The desbription on the back calls it 'readable and manageble' despite being 'penetrating and vigorous' but to be honest a lot of it went over my head. Philosophy loves to be obtuse but I think that's the point.

                    <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                    <p class="copy">
                    <strong>“We do not know anything at all: for it may be contended that there is no statement whatsoever that is not in itself susceptible to doubt.”</strong> (p10).
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“It may very well happen that even when people’s beliefs are false they are as fully convinced of their truth as they are of the truth of what they know.”</strong> (p16). <em>How do we know anything is ‘true’ when there’s no objectivity? It’s only true to us in one context at one point in time.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains the skeptical position that refutes using patterns from past experiences to predict and understand future events. He counters <strong>“if experience cannot justify the scaptic, neither can it refute him”</strong> (p39), meaning that the unpredictable events used as proof of the inability to form predictions from experiences should not hold more weight than the series of similar experiences that would lead to the development of a theory. <em>This is interesting because it makes both sides immune from critique.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“It is perverse to see tragedy in what could not conceivably be otherwise.”</strong> (p41).<em>If something was always going to be a certain way, is it a tragedy or an inevitability? When the pandemic shutdowns started I remember thinking it was strange that I lived my whole life not expecting it, yet it was always going to happen. It was always in the future waiting for us. Death is the same, it’s always there in the plan. These aren’t tragedies then if they are inevitable. Tragedy is when things don’t go according to plan or could have been another way?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“That we can discover our errors shows we have the power to correct them.”</strong> (p42).
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions the value of factual statements (“I am alive”, “I am conscious”) asserting identity, because to make them they have to be true, making them redundant. He then counters, <strong>"if I had been presumed dead there might be a point in my proclaiming I still existed.” (p49). He questions his own reasoning, “it is tempting to answer that I am saying nothing.”</strong> (p50). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy">In discussion of selfhood, Ayer claims, <strong>“there is nothing more to me than what can be discovered by listing the totality of the descriptions which I satisfy.” (p49), but then adds “but can it not be asked what it is that one is describing?”</strong> (p49). <em>The self is what is reflected off and perceived/described by others? Is this why we crave group membership because it provides labels with which to describe ourselves, and assert ourselves as a self?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer compares saying “I exist” to pointing at an event without words, <strong>“one does not speak of ejaculations or gestures as being true or false. But there is no difference in the information conveyed.”</strong> (p51).
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“If our aim is never to succumb to falsehood, it would be prudent for us to abstain from using language altogether.”</strong> (p52). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Our experiences are neither certain nor uncertain; they simply occur.”</strong> (p52). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“If one misdescribes the nature of one’s present experience, one must be doing so deliberately.. One must be saying something which one knows for certain to be false.”</strong> (p54).<em> Misdescribes how, because every person sees an experience differently, and your feelings about an experience can change while it takes place.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“While one is having an experience, one can know with absolute certainty the truth of a statement which does no more than describe the character of the experience in question is that there is no room here for anything short of knowledge: there is nothing for one to be uncertain or mistaken about. The vast majority of the statements we ordinarily make assert more than is strictly contained in the experiences on which they are based: they would indeed be of little interest if they did not.”</strong> (p56). <em>To make a statement worth sharing you have to add something beyond the experience at hand.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions how one knows they are experiencing anything and notes <strong>“the question [of] how it normally looks is relevant to the truth of what I am saying.”</strong> (p58). <em>Reality only exists in comparison to archetypes?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer describes using language, and that symbols <strong>“cannot be endowed with meaning unless they are used in accordance with a rule. But rules are public.”</strong> (p59). <em>Meaning is learned and constructed.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains how private experiences without labels have no means of being proven ‘true’ or ‘false,’ and that unshared labels are <strong>“not a symbol of anything at all.”</strong> (p59). <em>Private experiences are meaningless? Truth belongs to shared experiences.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“For those who have the use of language, there is an intimate connection between identifying an object and knowing what to call it. Indeed, on many occasions one’s recognizing whatever it may be is simply a matter of one’s coming out with the appropriate word.”</strong> <em>How do people without formal language think? Language forms the structure of our thoughts and worldview, but without it would we see in images or feelings instead of labels and objectivity?</em> <strong>“There is, however, a sense in which one can recognize an object without knowing how to describe it.”</strong> (p61). <em>Deja vu?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">In a discussion of proper labeling, Ayer explains, <strong>“one can be mistaken, after all, in the characterization of one’s present experiences. One can at least misdescribe it in the sense that one applies the wrong word to it; wrong because it is not the word which by the rules of one’s language is correlated with an ‘object’ of the sort in question.”</strong> (p62). <em>Who decides?</em> He continues examining private labeling, <strong>“it is plausible to argue that knowing what they mean is simply a matter of being disposed to use them on the right occasions, when these are presented.”</strong> (p62). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Some philosophers would argue that it is impossible to describe anything, even a momentary private experience, without venturing beyond it.”</strong> (p63). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“To describe is to classify.”</strong> (p64). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions how we can know any statement is ‘true,’ but concludes, <strong>“complete security is attained only by statements like ‘I exist’ which function as gesticulations. But the price which they pay for it is the sacrifice of descriptive content.”</strong> (p67). <em>The only true statements are so obvious they are not worth making.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“I answer the question how I know by referring not to experiences that I actually have but rather to experiences that I could have if I chose.”</strong> (p70). <em>We create our reality.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Nothing is known until somebody knows it.”</strong> (p70).
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions the objectivity of physical reality, <strong>“we have no access to physical objects otherwise than through the contents of our sense-experiences, which themselves are not physical.”</strong> (p76). <em>Nothing is real and directly ‘out there,’ everything we experience is interpreted and categorized before we realize we are seeing it.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Truisms may be a useful corrective to the extravagances of the more imaginative philosophers, [but] they are not philosophically enlightening.”</strong> (p82). <em>Philosophy is excess.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“It is only the things that one sees in one’s mind’s eye that are exclusively one’s own.”</strong> (p86).                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains the argument from illusion when perceiving objects, in which <strong>“objects appear differently to different observers, or differently to the same observer under different conditions, and further, that in the way in the appear is causally dependent upon the extraneous factors such as the presence of light, the position of the observer, or the state of his nervous system.”</strong> (p87). <em>Because of this, different people can experience objective reality differently. Objectivity is a myth, we are confined by our individual perception.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Light takes time to travel. From this it is inferred that we do not see physical objects as they really are at the time at which we see them, but only, at best, as they were some time before.”</strong> (p93). <strong>“It is possible that the object which we think that we are seeing has gone out of existence in the interval, we cannot ever identify it with what we see: from our personal experience will be the same, whether the object still exists or not.”</strong> (p94). <em>This is trippy that what we see could not exist anymore, and we really don’t know what the present looks like.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer describes ‘seeing’ as <strong>“something that has been accomplished,”</strong> rather than something that is taking place. He explains, <strong>“one can look at things without seeing them; one may be careless or inattentive or distracted.”</strong> (p99). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“It takes skill to observe the looks of things, as opposed to the things themselves.”</strong> (p103). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains the causal theorists perspective on perceiving objects that <strong>“even though the object may have ceased to be perceived, it cannot reasonably be thought of as rationing the properties which are causally dependent on the perception of it.”</strong> (p116). <em>So then what continues to exist after you stop perceiving it?</em> He continues, <strong>“unless a thing has the ability to exist unperceived it is not counted as a physical object.”</strong> (p119). He then describes physical objects as <strong>“permanent possibilities of sensation.”</strong> (p122) which is a description I love.
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains how recalling specific events assists memory, and <strong>“to have learnt a thing properly is to be able to dispense with them.”</strong> (p135). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“But how do I know that words which are written down in diaries do not spontaneously change their shape, so that what to-day appears as ‘Peacock’ might yesterday have appeared as ‘Thackeray’? For all sorts of reasons.”</strong> (p139). <em>This passage is hilarious to me. It really highlights how ridiculous and excessive a lot of philosophy is just questioning everything for the sake of it, but I love it. I love that we can think enough to question our own perceptions and our reality as a whole.</em> 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer paraphrases ‘Professor Broad’ on the permanence of memory, <strong>“to say that an event is past is not, in his view, to say that it does not now exist. On the contrary, he thinks that once an event has occurred, there is a sense in which it goes on existing for all time.”</strong> (p149). <em>This is a beautiful way to conceptualize the past.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Events are not in themselves either past, present or future. In themselves they stand in relations of temporal precedence which do not vary with time; if one event is ever earlier than another, it is always so. Or rather, since the position of events in time is fixed by their temporal relations, it makes no sense to apply temporal predicates to their possession of these relations themselves. What varies is only the point of reference which is taken to constitute the present. Every past event has been at different times both present and future; every future event will be present and then past; and every present event has been future and past.”</strong> (p152). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">In a discussion of the self in relation to time and environmental context, Ayer explains <strong>“even if it were possible to have one’s life over and over again, in the sense that whenever one reached a certain age one would proceed to undergo a series of experiences which were qualitatively the same in every detail as those that one has undergone since birth, this still would not constitute a literal recapture of the past. One term of this cycle would be necessarily different from another.”</strong> (p157). <em>You can never have the same conditions again, this life is only possible once.</em> He continues, <strong>“when people say, for example, that they would have like to have lived in Ancient Greece, it is certainly not obvious that the wish that they express is self-contradictory. The question is difficult because it is not at all clear what is required for the preservation of one’s personal identity. Our imagination, which allows us to roam freely about space, is also equal to the idea of a certain amount of transportation in time, but when the period in which it seeks to place us is extremely remote, there is an inclination to say that one would not in that case be the same person.”</strong> (p159). <em>There’s a kind of misconception that you just are who you are, but we are so shaped by our context, I don’t believe one would be the ‘same person’ if any life event was even slightly different. Every experience forms or changes a part of who you are. But in that case, what defines the self?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions time travel, and the direction of time, <strong>“we are accustomed to think of experiences leaving their shadow behind them, in the form, perhaps, of traces in our brains, but it is hard to envisage any physical mechanism by means of which coming events could cast their shadows before. Still, if the fact were established, it is to be presumed that some scientific explanation for it would be found.”</strong> (p166). <em>True, humans can and will justify anything with ‘rational thought.’ </em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer questions the difference between past and future, <strong>“there is nothing in this difference to warrant the conclusion that the future is open, or undecided, or unknowable, in a way the past is not.”</strong> (p168). <em>I guess the past is reinterpreted as present events change one’s thinking? Could the future also be just as ‘static’ as the past? Is everything already there or is it dynamic?</em> Ayer takes the deterministic approach <strong>“if an event will take place there is no way of bringing it about that it will not take place; what will be done cannot be prevented: for if it were prevented it would not be something that will be done.”</strong> (p168). <em>As much as this can be a depressing mindset, it’s also kind of reassuring? Although we do have a lot of autonomy in life trajectory and personal perspective on events, accepting uncontrollable events as inevitable helps you move on and evade excessive counterfactual thinking.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy"><strong>“There may, for example, be more processes in nature with similar ends but dissimilar beginnings than there are with similar beginnings but dissimilar ends; a suggestion which finds support in the hypothesis that the world is growing more uniform with time.”</strong> (p173). <em>I find this hard to believe considering all life evolved from a single cell. Maybe it will all converge back into a single cell too.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer discusses the importance of the unknown future, <strong>“if we always did know what the results of our actions were going to be, we should come to feel differently about them. Though none of their efficacy would in fact have been removed, we should not credit them with the same dynamic quality; we should regard them rather as elements in a pattern. Our attitude, even towards our own behaviour, would tend to be that of a spectator. It is because the future seems to us uncertain that we think we must strive to bring things about.”</strong> (p175). <em>Being cynical or depressed makes you think you know the results of your actions, which discourages you (me) from doing anything.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer discusses the components of the self, <strong>“the notion of a given individual comprises everything that is true of him. His history being what it actually is, to suppose it changed in any respect whatever would be to represent him as a different person.”</strong> (p177). He stresses the importance of the surrounding environment and past experiences, <strong>“any statement I make about him, whether true or false, turns out, on this view, to include within itself an account of pretty well the whole of human history. This conception of personal identity is, therefore, very quickly reduced to absurdity.”</strong> (p178). <em>Personal identity is quite individualist, assuming you can be anything without the world’s input. I like that all of human history is contained in each person.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“To identify me is, then, to say, not what, but who I am. It is to list some of the descriptions that I satisfy, and preferably those that I satisfy uniquely.”</strong> (p184). <em>Identity only exists in the eyes of, and in contrast to, others.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="copy">Ayer contemplates the soul, <strong>“how are we to tell, for example, whether the same soul inhabits different bodies, simultaneously or successively? Does it ever happen that two souls get into a single body? Can there be an exchange of souls from one living body to another?”</strong> (p185). <em>Some real romantic stuff going on here.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“There is nothing that especially makes a person the person he is.”</strong> (p188).
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer examines the relationship between the ‘self’ and the body they inhabit, or the mind/body duality. He notes, <strong>“men die, and their death does not at once destroy the identity of their bodies; but after a certain time at least, one ceases to identify the man with whatever remains of his corpse,” but asserts that physicality is the proof of existence, thus “the identity of a person is founded on the identity of his body.”</strong> (p189). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer cites the Humean view that <strong>“the self is a bundle of perceptions.”</strong> (p191).

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Suppose, for example, that, after a period of unconsciousness, one awoke to find things appearing much as they did before, except only that one’s body seemed to have vanished from the scene. One would not perceive it in any way at all, and other people, whom one would still be able to observe, although one could not make one’s presence known to them, would show by their behaviour that they did not perceive it either: one would observe that they acted as if one were dead. Would it not be reasonable in such a case to conclude that one had somehow survived one’s death? Such a story is indeed a fantasy. That one should continue to see and hear without sense-organs is causally impossible. But, as a fantasy, it seems to be intelligible. And, if it is even intelligible, we must be able to form a concept of personal identity which does not depend for its application upon the identity of one’s body.”</strong> (p193). <em>Is it a fantasy? This is basically what happened to me during the pandemic. In most online communication one’s body is divorced from their mind. Are we trying to escape the confines of the body? It’s a good reminder that the body is what’s allowing us to be alive. You can forget that without sense organs you would have no senses. The body is the conduit for experience with the world, without it there would be no life.</em>

                    <p class="copy">In his chapter, The privacy of experience, (I love this phrase) Ayer discusses the innately isolated nature of mental objects as inherently private. <strong>“Our thoughts and feelings, our dreams and imaginings, our sensations and memories, are things to which we alone have access. We can communicate them to others, in the sense that we are able to convey information about them, but we cannot transfer them to others.”</strong> (p199). <em>Isn’t that what art is for?</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer discusses how we can refute the question <strong>“what justification can I have for believing even that there are any experiences other than my own?”</strong> (p203), by observing others. He explains, <strong>“we quite often come to know what other people are thinking or feeling simply by observing them. One looks at a man and sees that he is angry or perplexed or bored or amused.”</strong> (p203). <em>It’s kind of a magical ability we have, but if you don’t observe others you don't get this reminder that there is life outside yourself.</em>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“A very good way to find out what another person is thinking or feeling is to ask him.”</strong> (p205). <em>This is true. I find people are usually one or two questions away from sharing their private emotions at any given time.</em>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer explains the view that experiences are <strong>“incommunicable. They have held that in so far as one uses words to refer to the content of one’s experiences, they can be intelligible only to oneself.”</strong> (p206). <em>So don’t just use words. That's what music and art and film are for.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Ayer notes that even if everyone’s experience is different, <strong>“what we can establish is that our experiences are similarly ordered. It is this similarity of structure that provides us with a common world.”</strong> (p207). <em>It doesn’t matter if your blue is different than my blue, we call it the same thing.</em>
