                    <p class="copy"> Published in 1979, this is a beautifully written collection of poetic essays on
                        personhood,
                        nature and the development of society by physician, educator, researcher, etymologist and poet
                        Lewis
                        Thomas.
                        In it he brings a biological perspective to the issues of modern society, as well as examining
                        the
                        roots and
                        development of the words, customs and beliefs we take for granted today. It helped me realize I
                        do
                        not know
                        enough about the wonders of the natural world.</p>

                <section class="copy-container">
                    <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                    <p class="copy">In the opening of the book, Thomas claims <strong>“we tend to think of ourselves as
                            the
                            only
                            wholly unique creatures in nature, but it is not so. Uniqueness is so commonplace a property
                            of
                            living
                            things that there is really nothing unique about it.”</strong> (p2). <em>Everyone is an
                            individual and
                            therefore exactly like everyone else.</em></p>

                    <p class="copy"> Thomas explains that different kinds of sensing mechanisms and markers allow
                        organisms
                        to
                        differentiate between ‘me’ and ‘other.’ It is these that enable us to reject and repel the
                        other,
                        and
                        conversely retain and protect the self. Sometimes these mechanisms get mixed up and two
                        organisms
                        merge into
                        one, as they do not know better to reject each other. (p2)<em> Is this what falling in love is
                            like?</em>.</p>

                    <p class="copy">When recounting a trip to the zoo in which Thomas experienced childlike joy while
                        watching
                        beavers and otters, he explains that ignorance was a prequisite for wonder. <strong>“I became a
                            behavioural
                            scientist, an experimental psychologist, an ethologist, and in the instant I lost all the
                            wonder
                            and the
                            sense of being overwhelmed. I was flattened.” (p7) The innate need to impose structure on
                            experience
                            robs it of its mysticism and joy.</strong></p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“Altruism, a jargon word for what used to be called love.” </strong>(p8)</p>

                    <p class="copy">Thomas notes how seeking life in space requires a level of novel thought probably
                        impossible to
                        humans. Perhaps there is life on Mars in some crevice or ravine, entirely isolated, but we are
                        so
                        caught up
                        in our own conceptions of what ‘life’ is that we’ve missed it entirely. <strong>“It is beyond
                            our
                            imagination to conceive of a single form of life that exists alone and independent,
                            unattached
                            to other
                            forms.” </strong>(p11). <em>I’ve often thought of this when reminded of extraterrestrial
                            life,
                            or even
                            how humans judge planets as ‘habitable’ or not. Why do we think other life forms would need
                            what
                            we need
                            to survive? Just as we seem perfectly adapted to our environment, would other life not be
                            perfectly
                            adapted to planets composed of toxic (to us) gas or even the vacuum of space. For all we
                            know
                            the
                            universe is crawling with other life forms, but we just can’t recognize them as life, and
                            maybe
                            they
                            can’t recognize us either, and maybe we can keep cohabitating like that for eternity.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">While comparing the hypothetical ravine-dwelling residents of Mars, Thomas explains
                        that such a
                        way of life is unfathomable because every life form on Earth is connected and
                        <strong>“everything
                            here is
                            alive thanks to the living of everything else.” </strong>(p12). <em>He speaks from a mainly
                            biological
                            perspective as a medical doctor, but socially this is also very true (I guess drawing a line
                            between
                            biological and social forces is kind of fruitless). I often feel like the world is a cold,
                            uninhabitable
                            void warmed only by the presence of people I love.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">Thomas describes humans as <strong>“perhaps uniquely among the Earth’s creatures,
                            the
                            worrying
                            animal” </strong>(p14), and yet this is what has led to our success as a species, because we
                        can’t just
                        sit still and accept things as they are.<em> We are always trying to change them, to categorize,
                            to
                            control.
                            It’s interesting reading this in a book published in 1980, which seems like a long time ago,
                            and
                            yet
                            nothing has really changed. I guess humans just perpetually thing their capacity to worry is
                            a
                            new issue
                            that means something is wrong with them or society or probably both.</em></p>

                    <p class="copy">In a discussion of DNA, or nature’s greatest marvel, Thomas says <strong>“given
                            enough
                            time, we
                            would have figured out how to do this, nucleotides, enzymes, and all, to make flawless,
                            exact
                            copies,
                            but it never would have occurred to us, thinking as we do, that the thing had to be able to
                            make
                            errors.
                            The capacity to blunder is the real marvel of DNA. Without this special attribute, we would
                            still be
                            anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music.”</strong> (p23). <em>This is such a poetic
                            way
                            to
                            underline how perfectionism annihilates progress.</em></p>

                    <p class="copy">A couple chapters later, Thomas contradicts himself by saying <strong>“mistakes are
                            at
                            the very
                            base of human thought, embedded there, feeding the structure like root nodules. If we were
                            not
                            provided
                            with the knack of being wrong, we could never get anything useful done.”</strong> (p30). He
                        describes
                        how the aftermath of the accident is when the breakthrough happens because it releases us from
                        the
                        script
                        and we actually have to think on our feet for once. <em>Mistakes often get blamed on ‘human
                            error’
                            (which by
                            the way isn’t real, it’s always the design’s fault), so we concern ourselves with becoming
                            more
                            precise
                            and avoid errors at all costs. Is that actually a route to greater ‘success’ though?
                            Fallibility
                            is
                            built into us because it allows us to create new paths that might be better. Maybe all the
                            perfect
                            humans went extinct because they never tried anything new.</em> Thomas ends the chapter
                        saying
                        that
                        instead of using machines to achieve perfection, we should harness their processing capacity to
                        compute more
                        mistakes than we could ever make. <strong>“Think of what could be gained from the near infinity
                            of
                            precise,
                            machine-made miscomputation which is now so easily within our grasp.”</strong> (p32).<em> Is
                            this
                            a
                            proactive defense of AI hallucinations? How can we reframe the mistakes AI makes into
                            opportunities? </em></p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“We are at our human finest, dancing with our minds, when there are more
                            choices than
                            two. Sometimes there are ten, even twenty different ways to go, all but one bound to be
                            wrong,
                            and the
                            richness of selection in such situations can lift us onto totally new ground. This process
                            is
                            called
                            exploration and is based on human fallibility.”</strong> (p31). <em>This serves as a
                            beautiful
                            description of the design process.</em></p>

                    <p class="copy">In a discussion of psychiatric patients claiming to have multiple personalities
                        Thomas
                        writes
                        <strong>“I am not sure that the number of different selves is pathological; I hope not. Eight
                            strikes me
                            personally as a reasonably small and easily manageable number. It is the simultaneity of
                            their
                            appearance that is the real problem, and I should think psychiatry would do better by simply
                            persuading
                            them to queue up and wait their turn, as happens with the normal rest of us.”
                        </strong>(p33).
                        <em>The
                            way Thomas writes about ‘the self’ is so relatable, as I have a tenuous grasp of myself at
                            best.
                            I can’t
                            keep up with myself and the way what I want and who I am seems to change daily. It’s
                            reassuring
                            to read
                            that somebody else feels the same way, that maybe everyone feels this way. Why doesn’t
                            anyone
                            talk about
                            how disorienting self-development is?</em> He goes on to explain <strong>“the only thing
                            close
                            to what

                            and left
                            the place before the next one was ready to start, and there was nobody around at all.”
                        </strong>(p34).
                        <em>This is how I’ve felt for years.</em>

                    <p class="copy">In a chapter about health care Thomas notes the growing attitude that humans are
                        essentially on
                        the verge of falling apart at all times and need constant tending. He notes that <strong>“as a
                            people, we
                            have become obsessed with Health. There is something fundamentally, radically unhealthy
                            about
                            all this.”
                        </strong>(p37), or more succinctly stated, <strong>“vitamins have taken the place of
                            prayer.”</strong>
                        (p37). <em>The health obsession is evermore pervasive now everywhere you look because us humans
                            are
                            terrified of death. We like to feel in control and what better way to evade death than
                            wasting
                            all your
                            money on products that promise you more life? The irony is we waste our lives working to buy
                            them, and
                            most of the health claims are just marketing terms with no basis in reality. Ignorance is
                            bliss
                            baby.</em></p>

                    <p class="copy"><strong>“We should be worrying that our preoccupation with personal health may be a
                            symptom of

                            contaminants,
                            spraying the room with deodorants, while just outside, the whole of society is coming

                    <p class="copy">In a discussion of the impossibility of creating a true clone of someone due to the
                        unreplicable environmental impacts on human development, Thomas notes <strong>“indeed, if all
                            you
                            had was
                            the genome, and no people around, you’d grow a sort of vertebrate plant, nothing
                            more.”</strong>
                        (p43).
                        <em>This is how I feel about generative AI when considering if it could have some form of
                            ‘consciousness.’ I
                            think experience is a requisite of consciousness (isn’t it basically what consciousness
                            is?).
                            Yes it
                            receives a lot of data, but it doesn’t exist anywhere, or experience the data in the way
                            humans
                            do. I
                            can also ‘receive data;’ sitting in my room I can read about being social (or a more
                            maladaptive
                            example, watch YouTube videos) to provide a surrogate social experience, but it’s completely
                            different
                            than the real thing. In isolation I am not really living, and neither is AI.</em>

                    <p class="copy">Thomas writes about the human endeavour to override and dominate nature and the
                        synthetic
                        environments we now spend most of our lives in. He questions <strong>“we will have everything

                            nobody to
                            talk to
                            but ourselves?”</strong> (p89). <em>Once we have destroyed everything else in the pursuit of
                            control,
                            power and money what will we have left to distract ourselves? Only the possibility is
                            enjoyable,
                            but
                            goals, once reached, are hollow and meaningless. Reality can never live up to
                            expectations.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">In one chapter, Thomas has a lengthy discussion of his liking for French philosopher
                        Michel de
                        Montaigne, and his thoughts on the self. Thomas cites Montaigne <strong>“I have seen no more
                            evident
                            monstrosity and miracle in the world than myself… The more I frequent myself and know
                            myself,
                            the more
                            my deformation astonishes me, and the less I understand myself.” (p120). Later he cites
                            again
                            “There is
                            as much difference between us and ourselves as there is between us and others.”
                        </strong>(p123).
                        <em>The
                            idea of ‘the self’ as a constant, driving force is a myth. The self is made of overlapping
                            parts,
                            reshuffling constantly, and so is everyone else. If only we could find enough overlap in our
                            depths to
                            tolerate and befriend everyone.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="copy">In the final chapter, Thomas claims <strong>“I can think of one thing that is wrong
                            with us and
                            eats away at us: we do not know enough about ourselves.”</strong> (p145), which is an
                        appropriate way to
                        end the book. Both in a personal, psychological sense, but also in a biological, environmental
                        and
                        anthropological sense, we do not know enough. <em>The more I learn about human history the more
                            I
                            realize
                            nothing changes, and the norms we live by are wholly arbitrary. Yes, there is value in
                            self-reflection
                            and ‘getting to know the self,’ but I think a pursuit of equal, or potentially greater value
                            is
                            learning
                            more about us as humans. It’s an excellent catalyst for reflection and understanding of the
                            self
                            and
                            others if nothing else.</em></p>
