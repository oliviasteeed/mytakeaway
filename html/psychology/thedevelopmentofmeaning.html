            <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Context </h2>
            <p class="copy"> The Development of Meaning is an account of several studies led by Dr. Joan Tough, a
                lecturer and researcher in education, published in 1977. The studies follow a group of similarly
                outgoing and intelligent children from ‘advantaged’ and ‘disadvantaged’ backgrounds (the only difference
                being parental education and profession) from age 3 to 7.5 to examine the differences in language
                development and expression that later influence the understanding of concepts and formation of personal
                meanings. Children were brought into a lab setting and encouraged to use language with games and social
                activities, then their utterances were analyzed in content and length to compare the expressions of the
                two groups, and the implications on conceptual understanding.</p>

            <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

            <p class="copy">When explaining the way children develop an understanding of grammar, Tough mentions
                <strong>“although Russian is a strongly inflected language, where word order has little importance,
                    children
                    at first order their words on the model ‘actor-action-acted upon’ in the same way that children are
                    seen ordering their first utterances in English.” </strong>(p16). <em>This suggests that there is an
                    innate way
                    of understanding and conceptualizing actions that is shared universally. I wonder if this is still
                    true, or if cross-cultural studies show variation. I would expect in collectivist cultures, the
                    order may be reversed, as the focus of attention is generally more on the context than the
                    actor.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy"> In discussing the differences already studied among ‘advantaged’ and ‘disadvantaged’ groups
                of children,
                Tough notes <strong>“a trend was discovered that pointed to the fact that the middle-class children more
                    frequently chose a noun for making reference, whereas the working-class children tended more
                    frequently
                    to use pronouns for reference.” </strong>(p22), and she goes on to suggest that
                <strong>“middle-class children achieve
                    more specificity and elaboration.” </strong>(p23). <em> Are middle-class kids encouraged to
                    speak more?</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Tough later elaborates on this tendency, using class as a lens to examine expressiveness.
                She explains
                that individuals in the middle-class experience more opportunities for autonomy over their futures, thus
                leading to more expression and explicitness. Tough writes <strong>“the need for motives and values to be
                    understood by children leads to the expression of feelings, and so to empathy, and the appeal for
                    understanding is directed to the individual. This explicitness is essential, for the basis of
                    understanding is, as it were, a theoretical approach to problems, and an examination of general
                    principles and possible alternative interpretations and consequences that might arise from different
                    courses of action and behaviour.” </strong>(p29). <em>Essentially, if you can’t have it now, you can
                    get it later.</em>
                Tough contrasts this with the realities of working-class individuals, asserting <strong>“the lower
                    working class
                    accept the restricted range of occupations open to them; work is the reality over which they have
                    little
                    control; they see little choice and prospect of change, so their hopes and ambitions are inevitably
                    limited.” </strong>(p29). <em>Because there is little hope of change, individuals are limited to
                    predefined social
                    roles and not encouraged to examine or reflect on different possibilities, because they are likely
                    out
                    of reach. These attitudes change how people conceptualize events and actions for the rest of their
                    lives. We are never equal.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Tough summarizes this concept by writing <strong>“it is the expectations and aspirations of
                    people that are
                    different and it is these differences that lead to different views of relationships with
                    others.”</strong> (p30).
                <em>We create our reality through our expectations, and we also change the lives of others by
                    limiting them to act in accordance with our preconceptions.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">In a discussion of how ‘meaning’ develops, Tough cites Roger Brown’s concept of <strong>“the
                    very naming of the
                    components of the world and the classification which ‘concept’ terms offer help the child to extract
                    principles and order the elements of experience.” </strong>(p34). <em>It is only through stuffing
                    the world into
                    boxes that we can make sense of it.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Tough also cites Vygotsky’s view that conceptualization is not simply <strong>“association,
                    attention, imagery,
                    inference or determining. They are all indispensable, but they are insufficient without the use of
                    the
                    sign or word or the means by which we direct our mental operations, control their course and channel
                    them towards the solution of the problem confronting us." </strong> (p35). <em>This implies that
                    without language, we
                    cannot think. What do children feel before they learn language? If we aren’t careful, language will
                    overpower embodied and sensory perception until we are as cold as machines. There is life outside
                    order,
                    or so I’ve heard.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Another point in Tough’s review of research on language use and meaning is the finding from
                Luria’s
                experiments that <strong>“children responding to a panel of lights, for example, were found to be
                    bringing their
                    actions under much greater control by ‘talking’ to themselves and verbalising instructions to
                    themselves."</strong> (p36). <em>Even imposing language on our own actions helps us understand and
                    control them.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">In support of the class explanation for language difference above, Tough explains that
                <strong>“the language of
                    others, then, direct’s the child’s attention so that he begins to take the perspective of those who
                    talk
                    with him. Where values are expressed, the child begins to attach importance to those aspects valued
                    by
                    adults, and begins to structure his own perceptions differently, putting different interpretation
                    upon
                    what he sees and hears.” </strong>(p36). <em>The way we speak to children literally creates their
                    worldview.</em>This is
                supported by studies of twins reared apart, in which <strong>“the world around now seemed to take on a
                    meaning
                    that was different for each twin.”</strong> (p37). Tough concludes by stating <strong>“the language
                    others are using
                    reveals the kind of value that they set upon aspects of their experiences and upon the worth of
                    other
                    people and the attitudes they take up towards other people.” </strong>(p37). <em>With this in mind,
                    merely speaking
                    feels like an exposure of one’s entire personhood. How invasive to be revealing one’s deepest values
                    as
                    a byproduct of pragmatic communication.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">In an examination of the relational aspects of language, Tough notes that in
                position-oriented families,
                which enforce a hierarchical dynamic, <strong>“the behaviour appropriate to the position of each child
                    in the
                    family will be made clear by example, and, as parents seek to control the child’s behaviour, they
                    will
                    appeal to him to behave acceptably, by referring to the characteristics of his role, and to the
                    status
                    and power of other members of the family.” </strong>(p62). By contrast, in a person-oriented family,
                parents
                would <strong>“see the child as a potential adult needing to learn how to be an adult and gradually
                    moving
                    toward this… He is expected almost to take an adult view of himself as a child. This is explained to
                    him
                    why he cannot do the things adults do because he is still a child and he is expected to agree to his
                    own
                    control and regulation.” </strong>(p63). <em>You need freedom to develop autonomy.</em></p>

            <p class="copy"><strong>“The basis of relationships in a [person-oriented] family is the projection into the
                    other’s feelings
                    and anticipated responses, and the recognition of the other’s part in the relationship.”
                </strong>(p63).
                <em>Presenting a family as equals, helping each other, is a much better plan to long term control.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy"><strong>“The position-oriented mother is likely to see the child as a child and to infer
                    that little knowledge
                    is within his reach. She expects him to play with other children because this is the traditional
                    activity for young children, so she releases him from her control quite readily. The parents may not
                    see
                    the child as a developing person to whom knowledge should me made accessible and so may be doing
                    little
                    to help him acquire basic everyday knowledge.
                    The person-oriented mother will see her child as a developing individual who is learning to share in
                    the
                    interests of other members of the family. Thus, she tries to make knowledge available to him. She
                    explains phenomena as they arise, they look at books, she is alert to what will interest him, and it
                    all
                    becomes part of her control strategies: appeal to reason, appeal to interest, appeal to
                    participation
                    and agreement and to the basic principles that govern their relationship.” </strong>(p63).
                <em>Children have to be
                    taught everything, and unintentional censorship based on a reductionist view of the child’s role
                    impedes
                    the development necessary to become a reflective adult.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">In more discussion of the social function of language, Tough asserts <strong>“all children
                    are seeking for
                    recognition as people who matter; all have needs, both physical and psychological needs, and all
                    children seek to establish their rights and worth in the eyes of other people. Much of the child’s
                    use
                    of language is concerned, then, with making others aware of him as a person, and in gaining
                    attention
                    and recognition.” </strong>(p65). <em>Why do we have an innate need to matter? Just being alive
                    isn’t enough, it has
                    to ‘mean something.’</em></p>

            <p class="copy">In the discussion of study results, Tough reports <strong>“the child from the advantaged
                    group is more likely to
                    use speech to project beyond the limits of the immediate situation. Children from the advantaged
                    groups
                    are seen to use language a great deal more than the disadvantaged groups for imaginative projection,
                    particularly in the creation and extension of imagined situations that go beyond the interpretation
                    of
                    concrete materials.” </strong>(p84). <em>How do you bridge the class divide when people structure
                    experience so
                    differently? What a way to keep people divided and static.</em>.</p>

            <p class="copy">Tough draws on Vygotsky again to examine the function of language on the interpretation of
                experiences.
                She paraphrases <strong>“language arises at the point of becoming aware of operating in a particular
                    way, of
                    making judgements, of evaluating and having intentions toward others. The very emergence of
                    language,
                    overtly or covertly, is evidence of the awareness of the self, and of the self’s own actions and
                    intentions. The differences in children in the way in which they interpret situations may be,
                    therefore,
                    not so much evidence of differences in their interpretation of such scenes in terms of needed
                    action,
                    but rather of differences in their awareness of the act they are making judgements about their
                    actions.”</strong>
                (p101). <em>Considering we experience the world differently from everyone else, it’s a wonder there is
                    any
                    cooperation in the world. Doesn’t it just fill you with empathy?</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Tough reports the differences in elaboration in the two groups, namely that the children in
                the
                ‘disadvantaged’ group tended to answer in short, vague replies, but could be prompted to share more
                detail when consistently prompted by experimenters. She writes <strong>“from the child’s response it
                    would seem
                    that he has the resources with which to make an interpretation, but either he is not aware of his
                    own
                    knowledge and needs help to bring it into a structure that is acknowledged and expressed, or the
                    meaning
                    is at hand but he does not see the necessity for expressing it. He is, therefore, either unaware of
                    the
                    interpretation he might make, or does not feel that it is appropriate to express his interpretation…
                    What can be seen is that the disadvantaged children, at 5 and 7, tended to give short responses
                    which
                    indicated that the picture was interpreted, not as a whole, but object-by-object, and that there was
                    a
                    general failure to infer possible relationships, causes and consequences from the visible evidence.
                    It
                    seems that the children were oriented to examine the situations differently and this was reflected
                    in
                    the more frequent use of different strategies of language.” </strong>(p103). <em>Are they not
                    listened to or do they
                    just not know to elaborate for lack of modeling?</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy"><strong>“The most important thing about memory is not storage of past experiences, but
                    rather the retrieval of
                    what is relevant in some usable form.” </strong>(p104).</p>

            <p class="copy">While examining the use of language to extend the concrete present into hypotheticals, Tough
                draws on
                Bruner to explain how initially imagery is used to understand experience, and then is overtaken by
                language. She cites <strong>“language comes from the same root out of which symbolically organized
                    experience
                    grew.” </strong>(p105), and goes on to explain <strong>“we are innately programmed to construct our
                    inner models of the
                    world and our language in the same way. But language and organised symbolic experiences, that is,
                    established images, only begin to relate to one another when the child is between 2 and 3 years old
                    and
                    language not only becomes part of experience but begins to modify it. Language is able to modify
                    experience only because it springs from the same innate capacity of the organism to organize
                    experience,
                    and because meanings for experiences are shared in a social world.” </strong>(p105-106). Finally,
                <strong>“as the child’s
                    model of language develops, it converges with the maturing organisation of experience, and the
                    structure
                    of experience. Since the structure demanded by language is often more evident than the structure of
                    experience, so language begins to exert an ordering effect upon experiences.” </strong>(p106).
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Tough illustrates the point above with evidence from her study <strong>“it seems that, as
                    Bruner proposes,
                    language has taken over from imagery, and there may be little vestige of gestures as evidence that
                    the
                    language we are using is supported by images built up from previous experiences. At the age of 3
                    years
                    the children from the disadvantaged group used language for recalling past experiences infrequently.
                    Now
                    again, at 5, we could see that although all children showed they could refer to past experiences
                    through
                    the use of language, the children in the disadvantaged group used language for this purpose much
                    less
                    readily that children from the advantaged group, and gave less information in their first
                    responses.”
                </strong>(p112). <em>Before language is used to structure experience we exist in a kind of timeless,
                    orderless, unquantifiable,
                    emotional and experiential daze.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">In one task in the study, children were given a bottle that could take in and shoot out
                water as they
                squeezed, and asked how it worked and why to gauge their understanding through verbal expression. Tough
                observes that <strong>“many of the children in the disadvantaged group… tended to so reduce their
                    explanations
                    that it was impossible for the listener to judge how much they understood.” (p139). She further
                    questions “do the children in the disadvantaged group ‘know’ less about the world around them than
                    the
                    advantaged group? Or do they for some reason ‘express’ less about what they ‘know?’ Or is it that
                    their
                    ‘knowing’ is different, that in Bruner’s terms it is within iconic or enactive models of
                    representation(DEFINE ME), and is not readily available within the symbolic mode. Or is it that the
                    child sees this kind of exploration as irrelevant and uninteresting, or sees discussing such matters
                    with adults as inappropriate?” </strong>(p140). <em>Does thinking less actually impact how much you
                    know?</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Tough also notes gender differences found in the studies influenced by class <strong>“there
                    was no difference in
                    the advantaged groups between boys and girls, but in the disadvantaged groups the mean score for
                    girls
                    was 1.5 and boys was 2.1.” </strong>(p140). <em>Is this due to the strict roles that Tough called
                    characteristic of the disadvantaged groups?</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">While examining morality and language, Tough refers to Piaget’s concept that
                <strong>“conceptual thought arises
                    from the child’s operations on the elements of experience, upon the objects and their attributes,
                    and
                    upon inherent relationships that are transformed by his actions.” (p141). She goes on to explain
                    that
                    “higher order concepts, and those not readily gained by direct experience, are likely to be far more
                    dependent on language for their development.” </strong>(p141). <em>Without language we cannot extend
                    past the
                    immediate reality of experience. I guess the grass is always greener.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">Tough also draws on Kohlberg to explain moral development, citing <strong>“only as children
                    reach a level of
                    cognitive development at which the meaning of moral concepts can be differentiated from punishment
                    can
                    they attain either a definite hedonism or a degree of disinterested respect for authority.”</strong>
                (p149). <em>Is
                    moral awareness a prerequisite for hedonism because it assumes you know better?</em></p>

            <p class="copy">In discussion of the study observations, Tough explains that the disadvantaged group
                produced less
                utterances overall, with the greatest difference in imaginative projection tasks, where <strong>“the
                    number of
                    words produced by the children in the disadvantaged groups was less than half that produced by the
                    children in the advantaged groups.” </strong>(p158). She goes on to explain <strong>“it was
                    precisely those uses that
                    were thought to reflect complex thinking that more frequently appeared in the talk of the children
                    in
                    the advantaged groups: little was revealed that could be described as ‘just talk’; all talk was
                    purposeful, even though it was not all at a level of adult thinking.” </strong>(p159). In addition,
                in a task in
                which children were told a story and then instructed to retell it to peer, Tough notes <strong>“a
                    tendency seen
                    in the advantaged group was to reduce the number of words needed, by using words that contracted
                    meaning… Perhaps this is an indication of a development towards a use of concise expressions. There
                    was
                    no evidence of such a development in the stories retold by the children in the disadvantaged
                    groups.”</strong>
                (p160). <em>This suggests that the children in the advantaged group have a greater understanding of
                    their
                    experience, so are able to reconstruct it more efficiently. Is more utterances evidence of greater
                    understanding, or does greater understanding lead to more confidence in one’s interpretation, and
                    therefore, more utterances?</em></p>

            <p class="copy"><strong>"In concrete situations where everyone can see what is going on, communication is
                    not entirely dependent
                    on the words used.” </strong>(p162).</p>

            <p class="copy">Tough gives examples of children’s speech during play with peers, to illustrate the cases
                when children
                in the ‘disadvantaged’ groups used long utterances. She ellaborates <strong>“what is the motivation for
                    being
                    explicit in these two examples? Each refers to the child’s own involvement in something that matters
                    a
                    great deal to him. In each case he is concerned to maintain his own self-interest. In spontaneous
                    conversations with their friends the longest utterances recorded by the disadvantaged groups all
                    came
                    from this use of language.” </strong>(p165). <em>If nothing else, the need for reinforcement of the
                    self and assurance of fairness is well
                    understood.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Tough eventually explains the difference in utterance length and complexity between the two
                groups by
                the way the children view experiences. She explains <strong>“this view is one that does not impose the
                    same kind
                    of structure and complex meanings on events and situations as children who are at advantage. The
                    disadvantaged children are not inclined to reflect on the meaning of their own experiences, or to
                    project readily on the experiences of others. They do not give explanations and justifications
                    readily,
                    nor do they reflect readily on past experiences, injecting them into the present to illuminate
                    understanding. Not do they anticipate the future readily and plan and consider alternative
                    possibilities. But it would seem it is not necessarily a lack of resources of language that governs
                    what
                    they do.The child’s disadvantage in school seems to stem more from a lack of motivation to think in
                    these ways, from lack of experience of thinking in these ways and from his general lack of awareness
                    of
                    meanings of this kind.”</strong> (p166). Tough further explains that children in the disadvantaged
                group evaded
                answering questions with ‘I don’t know’ type remarks, but could achieve the same level of elaboration
                when encouraged and prompted, and that the lack of response was due not to lack of ability, but
                <strong>“lack of
                    appropriate expectations, or lack of awareness of what they knew.” </strong>(p166). <em>The fixed
                    role in society
                    does not allow children to take chances towards growth.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="copy">When comparing the complexity of utterances between the two groups, Tough notes <strong>“the
                    children in the
                    disadvantaged groups used these features less extensively than the children in the advantaged groups
                    because the purposes for which they generally expected to use language did not require
                    them.”</strong> (p168).</p>

            <p class="copy">Tough considers interventions to support children in the disadvantaged groups, and notes
                that
                understanding and actively engaging these children is essential. She explains her view that education
                ought to prepare children to be active agents who can think critically and participate in democracy,
                stating <strong>“such objectives are concerned with self-discipline and responsibility, with
                    self-confidence and
                    self-expression, and with developing the ability to reflect, to analyse and to survey causes, to
                    reason
                    and anticipate possible consequences before taking action or reaching decisions. Basic to the
                    development of these skills is the motivation to think critically and to communicate effectively
                    with
                    others.” </strong>(p172-173). <em>Nurturing thoughtful and engaged citizens should be the purpose of
                    general
                    education, not competitive achievement.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Tough explains the importance of reflection and critical thought, citing Bruner again
                <strong>“there are
                    doubtless many ways in which a human being can serve as a vicar for culture, helping a child to
                    understand its point of view and the nature of knowledge. But I dare say that few are so potentially
                    powerful as participating in dialogue.”</strong> (p174). She explains how this necessitates
                appreciating and
                anticipating what one’s listeners know and understand to inform the creation of utterances, which
                children in the disadvantaged group did not display often. <em>Extending past egocentrism, to the
                    experience
                    of the other requires the ability to consider a reality other than your own. Empathy is a
                    prerequisite
                    to communicating effectively. Somehow everything comes back to those damn design thinking
                    hexagons.</em></p>

            <p class="copy"><strong>“Each individual has within him what is described by Kellner as his own ‘subjective
                    texture of
                    meanings’.” </strong>(p175).</p>

            <p class="copy">To build the ability to reflect, Tough asserts <strong>“the child needs continual
                    encouragement to make an
                    internal inspection of his own experiences and ideas. The child also needs help if he is to project
                    beyond himself and his own experiences.” </strong>(p176), and she explains this can include engaging
                in dialogue
                and prompting the child to discuss their experiences and understandings. She concludes that this kind of
                communication may be less prevalent in the disadvantage group, leading to the disparities in utterance
                complexity.</p>

            <p class="copy">Tough also emphasizes the importance of imaginative play on becoming reflective. She
                explains <strong>“the
                    children in the disadvantaged groups used imagination as they played the toles of others and renamed
                    objects, for example calling a stick a ‘gun.’ They did not, however, build up the imagined scene
                    using
                    language as the sole or major means of representation.” </strong>(p177). <em>This suggests that
                    engaging in
                    imaginative play within immersive scenes allows children to develop empathy, and become reflective
                    earlier.</em></p>

            <p class="copy">Tough concludes by asserting <strong>“the child is dependent on the skills of the teacher,
                    and on the view that
                    the teacher takes of him.” </strong>(p179). <em>Children are entirely dependent on their social
                    environment to teach
                    them how to be an effective human being, and my head spins with the impact of every action and
                    variable
                    on the development of the mind and self. This can extend past children though, as everything we do
                    in
                    the presence of others ‘teaches’ them what is normal and possible. Conversely, the way we react to
                    and
                    engage others teaches them what is acceptable, and can reinforce the social role they inhabit.
                    Acting
                    with intention and empathy are essential then to engage everyone around us to be more reflective and
                    understanding as well. The ripple starts with you.</em></p>
