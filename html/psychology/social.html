                <p class="copy"> This book, published in 2013,  is a survey of everything you need to know about social neuroscience from psychology professor Matthew D. Lieberman. It covers key concepts of social psychology that allow humans to harmonize, collaborate and understand each other at an incredible level. If you read one book about psychology, let this be it. (and maybe this and Thinking Fast and Slow if you read two).</p>

                <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                <p class="copy">When explaining the way children develop an understanding of grammar, Tough mentions
                    <strong>“Our brains evolved to experience threats to our social connections in much the same way they experience physical pain. By activating the same neural circuitry that causes us to feel physical pain, our experience of social pain helps ensure the survival of our children by helping them keep close to their parents.” (p5).
                    </strong>(p16).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that distinct brain networks handle social and nonsocial reasoning. He elaborates, <strong>“the more you turn on the brain network for nonsocial reasoning, the more you turn off the brain network for social reasoning.”</strong> (p8).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman suggests that the sense of self is critical to social collaboration and cohesion. He explains that <strong>“the sense of self is one of the most recent evolutionary gifts we have received.”</strong> (p12), and may be what allowed humans to develop shared beliefs which became society and culture.
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that <strong>“the default mode really does come on like a reflex. It is the brain’s preferred state of being, one that it returns to literally the second it has a chance.”</strong> (p21). The brain regions it illuminates are the same that are active when engaged in social cognition, suggesting that when we aren’t occupied with something else, we are thinking about others and ourselves socially. He explains that even infants show these patterns, and elaborates <strong>“two-day infants can’t even focus their eyes yet. In other words, the default network activity precedes any conscious interest in the social world, suggesting it may be instrumental in creating those interests.”</strong> (p20). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The prefrontal cortex is often thought of as an all-purpose computer; we can load it up with almost any software (that is, teach it things). Thus, the prefrontal cortex seems to have evolved for solving novel hard problems.”</strong> (p23).<em>Maybe it’s okay that AI will eliminate all the actual skill and leave us with only novel decisions? Other animals behave in patterns and what makes humans ‘special’ is we can consciously reflect and make decisions and change our behaviour.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains the creator of a popular intelligence test (he doesn't say who) asserted <strong>“social intelligence is just general intelligence applied to social situations.”</strong> (p24). <em>Does it require a certain level of intelligence to be successfully social then? This is counterintuitive.</em> Later Lieberman explains that social and general intelligence use different brain regions, <strong>“the brain regions reliably associated with general intelligence and its related cognitive abilities, like working memory and reasoning, tend to be the outer (or lateral) surface of the brain, whereas thinking about other people and oneself utilizes mostly medial (or midline) regions of the brain.”</strong> (p26). <em>Interesting that social functioning is deeper in the brain, suggesting that ‘rational intelligence’ is a newer development and socialization is a deeper trait that developed earlier.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Often, a friend’s primary value is the comfort of knowing we have friends. Despite the various ways friends can be directly useful to us, the fact that our friends are our friends is often an end in itself.”</strong> (p25). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“Is it just an accident that the single most successful destination on the Internet [Facebook at the time], or anywhere else, is a place entirely dedicated to our social lives?”</strong> (p25). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that humans have the largest brain size to body size ratio. Larger animals naturally have larger brains because <strong>“the bigger the body, the more brain tissue is needed to oversee it.” (p29), but humans have “approximately 11.5 billion neurons, which is the highest known number in the animal kingdom.”</strong> (p29). He suggests that <strong>“one of the primary drivers behind our brains becoming enlarged was to facilitate our social cognitive skills– our ability to interact and get along with others.”</strong> (p29). <em>I wonder what came first, because people living in groups likely had more resources and food, which would lead to bigger brains. I guess those people survived most?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman claims we <strong> “live in order to feed our brains,”</strong> elaborating, <strong>“in adult humans, the brain makes up approximately 2 percent of the total body mass yet it consumes (that is =, metabolizes), 20 percent of its energy. In prenatal infants, the brain consumes 60 percent of the body’s total metabolism, a rate that continues through the first year of life and only gradually declines to the 20 percent during childhood.”</strong> (p30). <em>If humans lived for another million years would we evolve to be just a brain? We sure don’t use our bodies much anymore. Now it’s all about ‘intellectual labour.’</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Humans don’t excel as a species because we are all innovators. Rather, one or more of us devise a solution to a common problem, and the rest of us learn the solution from that person by imitation or instruction.”</strong> (p31). <em>So we don’t all have to be famous.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar studied human development in relation to group living and theorized that the reason the neocortex grew in humans was to facilitate group living. He also analyzed the largest cohesive and productive social group various primates could have (called Dunbar’s number) which for humans is about 150. (p32). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">In explaining humans’ disproportionately large brain size, Lieberman explains <strong>“infants have to be born when they are because if the brain were to keep growing, human infants would not be able to be delivered.”</strong> (p41). <em>Will it be impossible to have a natural birth at some point but humans keep existing because of C-sections? Is this a natural limit to ‘intelligence.’ We are messing with evolution, hence we will destroy ourselves.</em> Lieberman writes that humans have <strong>“by far the longest period of immaturity [after birth] of any mammalian species”, and elaborates on the effect of postnatal brain development, “our brains are finished being build while they are immersed in a particular culture, allowing our brains to be fine-tuned to operate in that specific environment.”</strong> (p41).
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“Our biology is built to thirst for connection because it is linked to out most basic survival needs.”</strong> (p43). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“As awful as chronic pain can be, not feeling pain is far more disastrous. Children born with congenital insensitivity to pain are incapable of feeling pain and often die within the first few years of life because they injure themselves relentlessly, often falling victim to deadly infections.</strong> (p44). <em>An interesting angle to make you grateful for pain.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that physical and social pain are processed and experienced the same by the brain, and that <strong>“physical pain is no more physical than any other psychological experience we have.”</strong> (p45), so we cannot really distinguish ‘real’ and ‘emotional’ experiences. <em>This is wild, every experience is made of our your brain’s response so nothing is ‘real.’ Objectivity is a myth.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that infant mammals produce distress cries and produce cortisol (the Stress Hormone) when separated from their parent, but when given doses of morphine, they cease to produce cries. He concludes, <strong>“separation appears to cause drug withdrawal-like pain, whereas reconnection appears to act like a painkiller. Additionally, infants and caregivers show a reciprocal devotion that fits the description of addition.”</strong> (p50). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“Reptiles, from which mammals evolved, do not produce distress vocalizations, or any vocalizations at all– they are mute. And it’s a good thing because most reptilian patents would likely eat their young if the young reptiles drew attention to themselves.</strong>” (p54). <em>Why is this mind blowing that reptiles don’t make sounds? It must have been such a quiet world in the beginning.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Because pain feels like a single feeling while we are experiencing it, it’s counterintuitive to imagine that there really are separable components of pain. This is a general trick of how the brain works. There are commonly multiple distinct components to any experience, but by the time it reaches consciousness, it is integrated into something that feels like one coherent event.”</strong> (p52).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains a procedure from the 1950s called a cingulotomy in which the part of the brain processing pain distress was removed in patients with chronic pain. He explains that the patients, <strong>“report[ed] that they still feel pain, and they can point to where it is on their bodies and indicate how intense it is. But also they report that the pain now is ‘not distressing,’ ‘not particularly bothersome,’ and ‘doesn’t worry me anymore.”</strong> (p53). <em>This is insane that they could still ‘feel’ the pain, but not the distress so it didn’t bother them. Everything is mental.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains a study in which participants took Tylenol painkillers or a placebo every day for 3 weeks and then were exposed to a social situation within a video game in which they were socially rejected. The results, <strong>“by the ninth day of the study, the Tylenol group was reporting feeling less social pain than the placebo group.” (p65)  led him to conclude “taking Tylenol made the brain’s pain network less sensitive to the pain of rejection.”</strong> (p65). <em>Whaaaaat. Maybe less physical arousal makes us more socially resilient?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman erases the lines between physical and social pain with the statement, <strong>“suicide-related thoughts are actually quite similar among those who have been victims of bullying and those who have been victims of chronic physical pain, further supporting the link between the two kinds of pain.”</strong> (p69). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Evolution made its bet that suffering was an acceptable price to pay for all the rewards of being human.”</strong> (p70). <em>Would you rather be a happy pig or depressed human?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">In a study where participants ‘won’ an amount of money and then another participant would ‘win’ amounts of their winnings, reducing their take-home reward, it was found that the brain’s reward system was more engaged when both participants won about even distributions of the prize than when they won the entire amount. Lieberman explains, <strong>“in other words, fairness trumped selfishness.”</strong> (p74). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains a study where participants were put in an online situation in which strangers either did or did not want to chat with them online, then given brain scans to analyze brain response. The results were that being included socially activated the brain’s reward system, or as Lieberman puts it, <strong>“even strangers we don’t want to interact with activate the brain’s reward system when they tell us they like us.”</strong> (p77). <em>Online dating as just an ego boost.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“Money is a social reward– a reward for doing something of social value. Everyone who earns a salary is paid to do something others want done.”</strong> (p79).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that primary reinforcers are rewards we naturally want because we need them to survive (food, water) and secondary reinforcers are rewards that are not innately rewarding, but have the potential of leading to primary reinforcers. He asserts <strong>“money is the world’s most ubiquitous secondary reinforcer.”</strong> (p80). <em>Kind of wild when you remember money is made up. Anyways.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>Cooperation is one of the things that makes humans special. Many species cooperate, but as Melis and Semmann write, no other species comes close “to the scale and range of [human] cooperative activities.””</strong> (p81).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains the principle of reciprocity, <strong>“one of the strongest social norms we have”</strong> (p81), in which we feel the need to return favours, no matter how small and insignificant.
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">In a survey of thinking about human nature and self-centeredness, Lieberman explains the seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbs who created the axiom of self interest, or the assumption that <strong>“every man is presumed to seek what is good for himself naturally, and what is just,... accidentally.”</strong> (p83). Later, scientist and philosopher Richard Dawkins claimed <strong>“we try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish.”</strong> (p85). Lieberman eventually claims these views as false, as the need for a positive reputation encourages humans to act prosocially. In addition, he explains <strong>“mutual cooperation activates the reward system as an end in itself.”</strong> (p86), and that <strong>“the mechanism that motivates us to selflessly help others may be the intrinsic pleasure that we experience when we do it.”</strong> (p89).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Having strangers tell us they like us is pleasurable, in part, because we humans have generalized the positive feelings of being cared for by our mothers. Many mammalian species have shown opioid-linked pleasure responses in the brain while being groomed by their mothers or peers. But in humans most of our grooming is verbal rather than physical. While others spend time verbally grooming us, it is a sign that we are safe and cared for. And given out long period of immaturity, this is an incredibly reinforcing signal to receive.”</strong> (p92). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains how we are classically conditioned by our environment to enjoy certain stimuli because they are linked to other positive responses (think primary and secondary reinforcers too). He summarizes, <strong>“we gravitate toward things the brain has learned to associate with dopaminergic release.”</strong> (p93). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains a theory from social psychologist Dale Miller that people pretend to be more selfish than they actually are, for example when deflecting complements about hard work. He elaborates, <strong>“because we have been taught that people are self-interested, we conform to this cultural norm to avoid standing out.”</strong> (p98). <em>So if we assume everyone is cold and self-interested we act this way to fit in. </em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The single most important need of an infant mammal is to be continuously cared for by an adult, Without this, all other needs of the infant will go unmet, and it will die. Creating ways to keep us connected is therefore the central problem of mammalian evolution.”</strong> (p99).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>Having a poor social network is literally as bad for your health as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.”</strong> (p99). <em>He just casually says this? Can I get a source?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that our understanding of other humans is based on the assumption they, like us, are conscious beings making intentional decisions. He mentions German philosopher Franz Bretano’s argument that <strong>“the central fact of human psychology is that our thoughts are ‘Intentional.’”</strong> (p105-106), meaning they are purposeful, and about other things. He elaborates, <strong>“nothing else in the known universe has the intrinsic characteristic of ‘aboutness.’”</strong> (p106). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman argues that the ability to understand the thoughts and actions of others is an extremely underappreciated facilitator of all social interaction. <strong>“The modern world would stop in its tracks if we no longer had this ability to understand or predict the minds of others.”</strong> (p108). He further explains, <strong>“humans may be alone in the universe when it comes to their ability to thoroughly appreciate the nature of others’ minds.”</strong> (p111).
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman distinguished between deductive reasoning, where we use logical rules to determine what an outcome must be, and inductive reasoning, where we use past experience to predict a potential outcome. (p112). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Working memory and reasoning abilities both overlap with our concept of general intelligence.”</strong> (p114). <em>Is being ‘smart’ just having lots of working memory space to put things together?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman claims that it is because of our ‘mentalizing system’ that <strong>“we do not see bodies as mere bodies, but rather as sentient vessels directed by minds.”</strong> (p120). Or at least one would hope we see bodies as more than bodies, but being a woman tells a slightly different story.
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that engaging the mentalizing system to perceive others as conscious, intentional beings takes effort, and <strong>“because humans hate exerting effort”</strong> (p127) we sometimes use heuristics, or mental shortcuts, instead. Interestingly, <strong>“those who read fiction tend to have stronger mentalizing abilities, suggesting that engaging with fictional minds may strengthen this system.”</strong> (p154). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“The essence of successful inventing, Ford would say, is to figure out what people will want before it exists.”</strong> (p130). <em>The designer’s life.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman mentions mirror neurons, or motor resonance, which means the same neurons fire both when we watch someone else do something, and when we do that thing ourselves. He explains, <strong>“a long list of phenomena have been attributed to mirror neurons since their discovery, including our capacity for language, culture, imitation, mindreading and empathy.”</strong> (p133). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“The human brain reached its modern size around 200,000 years ago, and yet there is little evidence of advanced culture (for example, complex tools, language, religion or art) prior to 50,000 years ago. It has been suggested that some minor genetic change around that time served to push us over the tipping point, creating a cascade of self-reinforcing cultural development.”</strong> (p134). Why did it stop growing? Lieberman explains theories that the change was in working memory capacity, but it also could have been mirror neurons, as <strong>“our cultural development of skills and habits depends on our capacity for imitation.”</strong> (p134). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that there are two routes to understanding the actions of others. We can either use if-then statements to logically deduce their intentions, or ‘simulation theory’ to imagine ourselves in their place, and simulate our actions accordingly. (p138).
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy"><strong>“The mere perception of another person allows us to intuitively and automatically understand their experience.”</strong> (p139).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“William James famously notes how impressive it is that we see an orderly world of objects rather than a ‘blooming, buzzing confusion.’ Given that nothing in the world unambiguously tells us where one object ends and another begins, it is striking how easily we do this.”</strong> (p149).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The word empathy was introduced into the English language just over a century ago as a translation of the German word einfühlung, which means ‘feeling into.’ Einfühlung was used in the nineteenth-century aesthetic philosophy to describe our capacity to mentally get inside works of art and even nature itself, to have something like a first-person experience from the object’s perspective.”</strong> (p152). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that our capacity to ‘feel into’ others is part of how we understand the social world. He gives the example that when we see others get hurt, we unconsciously touch the same body part, or when we see others facial expression we unconsciously imitate it, and these responses aid our social connections. He claims <strong>“if a person is unable to mimic those facial expressions because of recent Botox injections that actually paralyze the expressive muscles in the face, that person will actually be worse at recognizing emotions in others.”</strong> (p153).

                <p class="copy">Lieberman notes a study in which women were placed in an fMRI scanner, and watched their boyfriends get shocked on the arm with electrodes. The scan results showed the same brain areas illuminated as those active when feeling pain oneself, implying that <strong>“it may literally be painful to watch a loved one feel pain.”</strong> (p155).

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that people with autism are less able to mentalize, or understand the thoughts and intentions of others, especially in relation to jokes, sarcasm and social norms (p163). He elaborates that this was thought to be due to the lack of Theory of Mind (understanding others are active agents with their own distinct perspective), but some children with autism still pass Theory of Mind tests, and Theory of Mind can be improved with training. Lieberman points to another conclusion, that people with autism are hypersensitive to external stimuli and have larger amygdalae (the brain’s fear factory), leading them to withdraw from the overwhelming world. <strong>“To the extent that an autistic child has a larger amygdala, that child will also tend to be more anxious– a sign that they may be overwhelmed by the environment. Autistic children also show enhanced threat detection, and their amygdalae do not habituate to faces like the amygdalae of non autistic children… Some evidence also suggests that autistic individuals are hypersensitive to sound and touch in addition to visual inputs.”</strong> (p176). People with autism look at faces differently than non autistic people, with nearly half as much time spent looking at the eyes, and this may be because facial expression is overwhelming, as Lieberman cites an autistic blogger, <strong>“for me, looking into another person’s eyes and having them look back into mine feels like I am touching a hot stove. I am being burned. It’s an extra jolt of overwhelming input.”</strong> (p174).  Lieberman elaborates, <strong>“during development, autistic individuals may learn not to attend to sources of emotional information because it is distressing, and thus in adulthood are less responsive because they are deploying this coping mechanism.”</strong> (p177), so it follows that <strong>“if overly intense experiences promote social isolation, these children might go on to miss countless interactions that would train their brains to become social experts.”</strong> (p174). This is backed up by the finding that children born deaf perform as poorly as children with autism on Theory of Mind tests, as <strong>“they are exposed to a socially impoverished environment in which conversations about or invoking mental state language are missed.”</strong> (p168). <em>WOWW IT’S ALL LEARNED.. I wonder what the thoughts of children born deaf are like, as they do not have the language that structures mental awareness and analysis. This is really fascinating that symptoms of autism may be caused by lack of social experience, not an innate social impairment. Does this mean if the hypersensitivity was reduced they would no longer qualify as autistic using diagnostic testing?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman also notes, <strong>“autism is associated with a deficit in focusing on high-level meaning both in seen objects and in language, and thus if a task requires a focus on detail at the expense of the whole, individuals with autism often excel, outperforming others.”</strong> (p166).

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains René Descartes’ dualist theory that the body and mind were entirely distinct entities, and although this isn’t ‘true’ per se, it is still the accepted understanding of the self. (p.181-812). Lieberman suggests the reason for the natural division is <strong>“not that minds and bodies are separate realms in reality, but the ways we register them are separated in our brains.”</strong> (p186), meaning we use different parts of the brain to think about our physical body and our personality and social connections.
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman paraphrases philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed <strong>“our sense of self is typically something constructed, primarily by the people in our lives.”</strong> (p190). Lieberman goes on to argue, <strong>"the self exists primarily as a conduit to let the social groups we are immersed in supplement our natural impulses with socially derived impulses.”</strong> (p192). He goes on, <strong>“it is hard to look inside and really know why we are, and thus we tend to look to others, both intentionally and unintentionally, to find out.”</strong> (p192). <em>This is so right. In the West, we tend to think of the ‘self’ as a discrete and independent entity, but we are formed by the situations we find ourselves in. You can only really be someone when you are reflecting off of someone else. I know because when I am all alone, I am no one. </em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains that humans are automatically and innately influenced by those around us, which leads us to follow expectations and scripts. He notes, <strong>“in the West, we call this conforming, something looked down upon. But in the East, the same behaviour is called harmonizing, something essential for successful group living.”</strong> (p195). <em>Is this why society is falling apart? We forgot that this only works if we harmonize.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains a study in which participants in California were surveyed about sunscreen use, shown videos emphasizing the importance of sunscreen while in an fMLI scanner, surveyed again on their attitudes towards sunscreen use going forward, and then contacted a week later to verify their actions. What participants said they would do had little relation with their behaviour, but the amount that the brain area relating to the ‘conceptual sense of self’ was active while watching the ads did. (p198). In a follow up, the procedure was repeated but with smoking cessation ads, and again, people rated the ad effectiveness differently than the actual results, but the brain activation matched. To be persuasive and create lasting change, you need to engage the audience’s self concept, sometimes unconsciously, which changes how they will see themself in the long term. Lieberman calls the activated part of the brain <strong>“the superhighway by which others influence our beliefs and behaviours.”</strong> (p200).

                <p class="copy">In discussion of intelligence and IQ, Lieberman notes a study in which <strong>“GPA was better predicted by a person’s ability to delay gratification than by their IQ.”</strong> (p206). <em>Intelligence is control.</em> Lieberman goes on to explore the notion of ‘self-control’, noting that <strong>“one of the defining characteristics of self-control is that it seems to be a limited resource. Essentially, we can engage in only one kind of self-control at a time.”</strong> and that <strong>“engaging in two forms of self-control in sequence can be problematic as well.”</strong> (p207).

                <p class="copy">Lieberman considers suppression and reappraisal as opposing tactics to coping with distress. To explain reappraisal, he cites Marcus Aurelius, <strong>“if you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your estimate of it; and thus you have the power to revoke it at any moment.”</strong> (p216). and author Haruki Murakami who condensed this to <strong>“pain is inevitable. suffering is optional.”</strong> (p217).

                <p class="copy">In discussing emotional regulation, Lieberman notes, <strong>“putting our feelings into words or simply being able to label them can regulate our emotions and promote mental and physical well-being without our realizing at all.”</strong> (p219). <em>Is this the jump that created the human culture explosion? How do the children that are born deaf understand the world and themselves if they cannot label anything? Language puts a scaffolding around our thoughts that makes us much more effective.</em> Lieberman explains a study in which participants labeled emotions (affect labeling) and the finding, <strong>“the more negative participants’ labels were, the better the final results. Just like reappraisal, affect labeling regulates our emotions and thus appears to be a kind of implicit self-control.”</strong> (p220). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman recounts the opening of the novel A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood, <strong>“as he wakes, George is merely ‘experience– an entity experiencing’ without any self-awareness. There are impulses, burgers, and even aches. Pure experiences. But then he looks in the mirror. ‘It stares and stares… until the cortex orders it impatiently to wash, to shave, to brush its hair. Its nakedness has to be covered… It’s behaviour must be acceptable to them.”</strong> (p223). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman claims, <strong>“self-control is the price of admission to society.”</strong> (p224) and that <strong>“society values our self-control more than it values our quality of life.”</strong> He goes on, <strong>“we have a greater general trust in those who display self-control.”</strong> and suggests that formal education is <strong>“just as much a competition over self control.”</strong> (p225). <em>Humans are desperate for control so we worship it in the people we make famous (athletes, models, the beautiful and the disciplined). </em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Lieberman compares our compulsion for self control when being watched to Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, explaining <strong>“is it sufficient for people to know they are seeable, and that there is the potential for them to be judged, evaluated, and punished. Being seeable is enough to trigger us to restrain our unsocialized impulses through self-control.”</strong> (p228). This does not have to be literal oversight, as Lieberman explains, as a study that placed posters with an upside-down triangle of three dots, representing an abstracted face, in a public cafeteria reduced littering by half compared to standard posters. (p229). In addition, when people can see themself in a mirror, as how others see them, they have greater self-control. <em>Graphic design pro tip: subliminal reminders that someone is always watching.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The income of individuals and nations was long taken as an objective indicator of their well-being… This assumption in sine ways may have led money to be seen by society as an end in itself, rather than as a means to an end.”</strong> (p243).

                <p class="copy">Lieberman explains the fault of this measurement, <strong>“if you are below the poverty line, every additional $1000 you earn dramatically alters your well-being. But once your basic needs are met, increasing income only adds the tiniest bit to well-being.”</strong> (p244). He notes economist who track individuals across decades to identify how income changes well-being, and the finding that <strong>“some people were making substantially more money at the end of ten years and some were making substantially less, but well-being was unrated to these changes”</strong> (p245). <em>When is it enough?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">“Having a friend whom you see on most days, compared to not having such a friend, had the same impact on well-being as making an extra $100,000 a year… ‘Good’ health, compared to ‘not good’ health [was] equivalent to about a $400,000 salary bonus.” (p247). Remember how rich you really are. Money is a means not an end. Fulfillment and happiness come from the intangibles.

                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Lieberman notes that in a 2004 survey asking respondents how many close friends they had, the most common answer was zero, as opposed to three in 1985. (p248). One of the reasons for this is the lack of social infrastructure in cities. Lieberman compares college dorms, built to create connections, with apartments, which are innately isolating, and the reason for this: <strong>“different motives. Colleges are concerned with having a vibrant community; apartment builders are concerned primarily with profit and the costs per square foot.”</strong> (p252). He notes that <strong>“throughout our childhoods and young adulthoods, our social lives are curated by others. Couldn’t we find a way to replicate that in our adult communities as well? Why don’t we have someone on each apartment floor designated to create social activities?”</strong> (p253). <em>This is interesting because everyone wants to be invited but nobody wants to plan. It’s like socialization as an activity is strange and we expect it to be built into our lives, not an active pursuit (which makes sense).</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“When people are prompted to think about money, they become motivated to work more and socialize less. But when people are prompted to think about time, the reverse happens; people become motivated to work less and socialize more.”</strong> (p254).

                <p class="copy">Liberman explains the strong influence of social relationships on well-being and stress management, <strong>“just thinking about or writing about a loved one can provide some of the benefits of face-to-face social relationships… a picture of a loved one is a strong enough social reward to overcome some kinds of distress.”</strong> (p254). <em>This is why people are addicted to social media. I wonder how long the images are effective? How long is a relationship sustained by just seeing someone and not directly  interacting with them?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Liberman explains that people use television and social media as a crutch when they feel lonely, as it’s a faster way to reap some social rewards without the effort of actual socialization. However, he explains, <strong>“television does satisfy these social needs to some extent, at least in the short run. Unfortunately, it is also likely to ‘crowd out’ other activities that produce more sustainable social contributions to our social well-being.”</strong> (p255). <em>As always, it's a trap.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p class="copy">Liberman also notes internet usage, including one study that found <strong>“individuals who used the internet more decreased communication with their families, had shrinking social networks, and reported increased depression and loneliness.”</strong> (p255). This is likely for the same reason, that it crowds out other activities. <em>People talk about the amazing social potential of the internet, but is anyone actually happier and more connected? Having many light connections or knowing about many people is not fulfilling, it just gives you a wider pool to compare yourself to. For me, relationships have to be in-person to be worthwhile at all.</em>

                <p class="copy">In a discussion of social psychology and business, Liberman mentions David Rock’s SCARF model of motivating employees. It consists of “status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness and fairness” and what Rock calls <strong>“the primary colors of intrinsic motivation.”</strong> (p259).

                <p class="copy">Liberman explains that the opportunity to care for others in the workplace is a counterintuitive way to increase productivity and satisfaction because <strong>“we are reinforced by the actions we take to care for others” and “the chance to help others motivates people to work harder in the workplace.”</strong> (p264). Liberman notes professor Adam Grant’s insight that <strong>“for most people in most lines of work, doing something meaningful means helping others. It is hard to find meaning in what we do if at some level it doesn’t help someone else or make someone happier.”</strong> (p264). Therefore, to motivate others, you can simply remind them of how their work helps others. (p265). <em>We can only be fulfilled when we extend beyond the self and have a ripple somewhere else, otherwise we are a black hole.</em>

                <p class="copy">Liberman mentions a study in which ‘task-oriented’ managers were rated as being in the top 10 percent of leaders at a company 14 percent of the time, whereas relationship-oriented leaders were rated in the top 10 percent 72 percent of the time. (p270). Liberman concludes, <strong>“social skills improve the value of all other competencies because they allow leaders to manage the social and emotional responses of their employees.”</strong> (p270). <em>Hard skills are potential but soft skills put things in practice.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Liberman also mentions that <strong>“intelligence and empathy were each associated with leadership, however, intelligence and empathy were negatively correlated with one-another.”</strong> (p272). <em>I wonder why this is?</em>

                <p class="copy">In an examination of the education system in relation to social psychology, Liberman suggests that the reason many adolescents lose engagement with school is that it does not satisfy their strong social needs. He explains, <strong>“there are myriad reasons why academic performance and interest drop in junior high, but one non obvious reason may be that the need to belong, our most basic social motivation, is not being met.”</strong> (p276). Liberman later mentions that high bullying-rate schools have lower academic test scores, and attributes this to the social pain that students face from bullying, similar to chronic physical pain which is <strong>“associated with cognitive impairments like diminished working memory.”</strong> (p278). He elaborates, <strong>“a person in pain is likely to be fixated on that pain, whether it’s physical or social, and this focus would leave fewer cognitive and attentional resources free to focus on the lesson of the day.”</strong> (p278). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Liberman explains that adolescents are wired to be social, and this is to their benefit. He elaborates, <strong>“evolutionarily, the social interest of adolescents is no distraction. Rather, it is the most important thing they can learn well.”</strong> (p283). He argues that schools should not discourage the social aspects of school, but lean into them as socializing improves memory and comprehension. Liberman explains one study in which participants read statements describing normal behaviours and were asked to memorize them for a test or form an impression of the person exhibiting the behaviour. The people forming an impression did much better on the memory test, employing a phenomenon called the ‘social encoding advantage.’ (p284). Lieberman asserts, <strong>“social encoding leads to better memory performance than actually trying to memorize.”</strong> (p285).

My psychology courses have been (one of) my enlightenments and made me so much more understanding and empathetic. I am a better person in the world now.</em>

                <p class="copy">In a discussion of social psychology and physical activity, Lieberman explains that <strong>“new neurons can be born in adulthood, and this process might be stimulated by exercise.”</strong> (p294) and study findings that suggest physical self-control practice from motor tasks can improve emotional regulation. He summarizes the study, <strong>“the better an individual got at motor self-control over the course of the eight training sessions, the more their emotion regulation ability improved.”</strong>(p297). <em>I wonder if doing yoga makes you have amazing emotional regulation then?</em>
