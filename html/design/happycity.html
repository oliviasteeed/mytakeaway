                <p class="copy">Published in 2013 by urban engagement specialist and Vancouverite Charles Montgomery, this is a survey of the powerful influence of urban design on wellbeing and social connection. It examines the impacts of ‘advances’ like cars, and the social impacts of the dispersed cities familiar in North America. Read this to want to move to a commune and travel everywhere by bike.

                <h2 class="copy-subtitle"> Takeaways </h2>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Freud from Civilization and Its Discontents, <strong>“the question of the purpose of human life has been raised countless times; it has never yet received a satisfactory answer and perhaps does not admit of one… We will therefore turn to the less ambitious question of what men show by their behavior to be the purpose and intention of their lives. What do they demand of life and wish to achieve in it? The answer to this can hardly be in doubt. They strive after happiness; they want to become happy and remain so.”</strong> (p17).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains the Athenian concept of eudaimonia, an overall state of human flourishing translating to <strong>"being accompanied by a good spirit."</strong> (p19)" Aristotle claimed health, friends, power, good fortune and material wealth were contributing factors, but were not enough on their own, as <strong>“existing for pleasure alone was a vulgar state benefiting animals.”</strong> (p19). He asserted, <strong>“a man could achieve pure happiness only by reaching the height of his potential, and that meant not just thinking virtuously but behaving virtuously too.”</strong> (p19).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">In explaining the science of happiness, Montgomery summarizes that the left prefrontal region of the brain is activated when people feel ‘happy,’ and receives more blood flow in ‘happier’ people. This is seen most strikingly in the fact that people with brain damage in this region <strong>“quite suddenly lose their sense of enjoyment in life.”</strong> (p30). In contrast, poor mood is associated with increased blood levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery summarizes an experiment by Daniel Kahneman in which over 900 adult women in Texas were surveyed on happiness levels in relation to daily tasks. <strong>“Of all ways they passed their days, having sex made the women the happiest of all, with socializing coming a close second. What made them least happy? Commuting to work.”</strong> (p31).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains environmental impacts on wellbeing as discovered in the field of environmental psychology, <strong>“research has proved, for example, that we are bothered by snakes, spiders, sharp edges, loud, unpredictable noises, darkness, and dead-end alleys, but we enjoy novelty, soft edges, nice scents, gentle surprises, and pleasant memories.”</strong> (p31-32). <em>Implications for design.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery summarizes variables impacting happiness, as deduced from World Values Surveys and the Gallup World Poll, <strong>“after countries reach the standard of living that many first world countries hit around 1960, happiness and gross national product stop following the same trajectory. Income matters, of course, but it is only part of the story.”</strong> (p34). Other factors correlating to increased happiness are education, employment, living in a small town or next to the ocean, leisure time, shorter commutes, feeling healthy (which is more important than ‘objective’ health), attending religious gatherings and volunteering.
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Aristotle offered us the image of a cow in the field, contentedly chewing its cud. He was absolutely clear that this is not what eudaimonia is about! It’s about getting up every day and working very hard toward goals that make your life meaningful, sometimes in ways that are not at all conducive to short-term contentment… In fact, it may not be contentement at all. It’s the realization of talent and potential, and the feeling that you are able to make the most of your abilities in life.”</strong> (p36). <em>The great debate of to live in unremarkable peace or manic excellence. </em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery shares developmental psychologist Carol Ryff’s prerequisites for eudaimonia: <strong>“self acceptance, or how well you know and regard yourself; environmental mastery– your ability to navigate and thrive in the world; positive relations with others, personal growth throughout life; sense of meaning and purpose; feelings of autonomy and independence.”</strong> (p36). The more elements one has in their life, the less cortisol they have in their saliva, and the less at risk for heart disease they are. The ideal is not living an easy life, but what Ryff calls <strong>“challenged thriving”</strong> (p37).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery summarizes economist John Helliwell’s finding that, based on examination of the World Values Survey and Gallup World Poll, <strong>“when it comes to life satisfaction, relationships beat income, hands down… Just going from friendless to having one friend or family member to confide in had the same effect on life satisfaction as a tripling of income.”</strong> (p38). <em>You cannot be fully independent.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that we are predisposed to trust others, and cooperation with them leads to release of oxytocin, the <strong>“neurotransmitter whose first task is to tell receptors in the pleasure centers of the brain that it’s time to feel what we typically describe as ‘warm and fuzzy.’”</strong> (p39). In a cyclical fashion, the more oxytocin you have, the more likely you are to trust and help others, further increasing oxytocin levels.
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Each of us benefits when some of us subsume private goals for the sake of the community, and everyone benefits when everyone cooperates. As the oxytocin studies illustrate, our brain rewards us for working well together. At the same time, the drive by each of us to promote our own interests creates a dynamism and wealth that can overflow through the city. We all embody the tension between selfishness and altruism.”</strong> (p41).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Aristotle’s Politics, <strong>“he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.”</strong> (p44).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery describes the suburbs, or “sprawl,” a place where <strong>“over here are the residential zones, generally distinguished by detached homes, broad lawns, and wide, curving streets, each zone anchored by an elementary school. Over there are commercial districts, or power centers, where national retailers occupy warehouse-size boxes clustered like islands in dark oceans of parking. Ans over there are the office and industrial parks, with their own ample surface car-storage zones. All of these distinct urban units are connected by high-speed freeways and arterial roads so generous that they have obliterated the once-meaningful metric of proximity… Distance is reduced to abstraction. Home is simultaneously far from and close to everything else, depending on the number of cars on the road at any moment.”</strong> (p46). Despite its popularity, sprawl is the least space, resource and utility efficient and <strong>“more expensive to build and operate than any urban form ever constructed.”</strong> (p47).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains a theory that the decreasing happiness in the United States, while income increases is because of <strong>“declining social capital.”</strong> (p53). He explains, <strong>“a healthy social network looks like the root mass of a tree. From the most important relationships at the heart of the network, thinner roots stretch out to contacts of different strength and intensity. Most people’s root networks are contracting, closing in on themselves, circling more and more tightly around spouses, partners, parents, and kids.” (p54). Sprawl socially engineers people to be less involved in their communities because people spend more time commuting, and see neighbors with less regularity, resulting in less light social relationships, and worse wellbeing. Montgomery points to a Swiss study that found “psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, are most common in neighborhoods with the thinnest social networks. Social isolation just may be the greatest environmental hazard of city living–worse than noise pollution, or even crowding.”</strong> (p54).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“There is nothing worse for mental health than a social desert.”</strong> (p54). <em>I'm starting to realize that people who live in the city just go out and do things and it's not something you make a big deal and plan out like us suburbanites do.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains, <strong>“as we continue to sprawl our cities, we are actually making it harder for social interactions to occur.”</strong> (p58). Longer commutes also correlate with dispersed friends, which makes seeing each other more difficult.

                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The more people hung out with family and friends in any particular day, the more happiness and enjoyment they reported, and the less stress and worry… The happiness curve doesn’t level off until it hits six or seven hours of social time a day.”</strong> (p58). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that cities were seen as dangerous, dirty, undesirable places and car companies strongly influenced governments to promote suburbs as the solution to the city problem; a quiet, safe and private place that separated home, retail and work into discrete zones. Zoning laws were put in place to codify the separation that still govern the use of land in most cities today. The result is a dispersed, car-dependent, isolated and monotonous sprawl. (p66-69). <em>In a way, the sprawl is the ultimate example of individualism. We cannot commute together, we cannot live together, we must be separated by fences and walls. We architect ourselves into a space of solitude and then reap the rewards of loneliness and meaninglessness.</em> 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that roads used to be common places for pedestrians, cyclists and wagons alike, but were stolen by cars in the name of freedom, according to car companies. <strong>“It was not the freedom to move as one pleased. It was the freedom for cars, and cars alone, to move very quickly, unhindered by all the other things that used to happen on streets. The enemy of freedom was friction! The nation needed roads unhindered by the friction of intersections, parked cars, and even roadside trees.”</strong> (p73). <em>Friction reminds me of ux design. Is the ‘right answer’ really to make some actions frictionless or does that just make it too easy to exploit them? Is efficiency the answer? Where are we rushing to? Driving fast is a unique pleasure, and once you have a pleasure it’s hard to give up so I guess I understand how we got addicted and threw away everything else to chase the next high. Driving makes you feel a little too powerful though. It’s an act of reinforcing individualism as you travel in your own climate, with your own soundtrack at your own speed. It reduces other people to obstacles.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Daniel Kahneman, <strong>“nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.”</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains the evolutionary happiness function, a formula that describes happiness as your success minus your expectations equalling your social status. He explains, <strong>“the brain constantly adjusts its idea of what we need in order to be happy. It compares what we have now to what we had yesterday and what we might possibly get next. It compares what we have to what everyone else has. Then it recalibrates the distance to a revised finish line. But that finish line moves even when other conditions stay the same, simply because we get used to things. So happiness, in these economists’ particular formulation, is inherently remote… We are hardwired for active dissatisfaction.”</strong> (p81). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“We are always comparing what we have to something else. But we’re not anticipating that no matter what we have, we will always be comparing it to something else. In fact, we’re not even aware that we’re doing this. But there’s a difference between what is natural and what is good for us.”</strong> (p81). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“A person with a one-hour commute has to earn 40 percent more money to be as satisfied with life as someone who walks to the office. On the other hand, for a single person, exchanging a long commute for a short walk to work has the same effect on happiness as finding a new love.”</strong> (p83). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery differentiates between extrinsic motivators, which are external rewards we can buy to perform a desired status, and which only increase short-term happiness until we get used to them and start thirsting for the next thing. Intrinsic motivators <strong>“contribute to the resilient kind of happiness that Carol Ryff wrapped up in her map of eudaimonia”</strong> (p84), and relate to feeling competent and connected.
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains the focusing illusion, in which choices are compared based on select obvious differences instead of the amount of similarity. This leads to overestimating the difference in wellbeing each will bring, as evidenced by a study between two dorms at Harvard in which both fancy and pragmatically designed buildings resulted in the same level of student happiness, despite initial student predictions. (p86-87).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The confusing thing about tomorrow is that it will be different from today. The cognitive error that may have had more influence than any other on the shape of our cities is known as presentism: we let what we see and feel today bias our views of the past and future. This commonly expresses itself as a tendency to assume that the ways we think and act will not change as time passes.”</strong> (p99).
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“To get closer to one another, we need a little more distance from one another, and a little more nature.”</strong> (p106).
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery summarizes a study in which nature is shown to increase prosocial behaviour and happiness. Participants were shown a slideshow of nature or city related images, and then tested on attitudes. He explains <strong>“the nature viewers were much more likely to say they values deep relationships with other people than city viewers, who came out more focused on extrinsic goals, such as getting rich.”</strong> (p111). After the study participants were given $5 to keep or donate, and the amount of generosity correlated to the amount of nature imagery seen.

                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Nature deprivation [is] not merely unhealthy, it was dangerous, partly because it [leaves] people feeling more raw and aggressive, and partly because most residents simply [abandon] barren spaces, removing the watchful eyes that keep them safe.”</strong> (p110). 

                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that living in dense cities leads to feeling chronically crowded and overwhelmed, leading people to withdraw and lose strong social connections. The result is that <strong>“people who live in residential towers, for example, consistently tell psychologists that they feel lonely and crowded at the very same time.”</strong> (p126). To remedy this, people need the option of moderating contact with others.

                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“We tolerate other people more when we know we can escape them.”</strong> (p127).

                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“The lighter relationships we have in volunteer groups, with neighbors, or even with people we see regularly on the street can boost feelings of self-esteem, mastery, and physical health, all contributors to that ideal state that Caroll Ryff called ‘challenged thriving. The uncomfortable truth is, our spouses and children and coworkers can wear us out. Life’s lighter, breezier relationships soothe and reassure us, specifically because of their lightness.”</strong> (p127-128). <em>This is what we lost in the pandemic, and there’s a period of awkwardness and uncertainty at the start that is preventing us from engaging with them again.</em>

                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that architecture has a profound impact on social connection. He explains a study between two university dorms, one with a row of suites connected by a hallway, and one with bedrooms connected to common bathrooms, lounges and kitchens. The students in the suites avoided contact with each other and became more antisocial, whereas the students with shared semi-private spaces became friends. (p129). There needs to be a gradient between public and private space. <em>Video conferencing for work is similar to the hallway setup because there’s a whiplash between public and private space, except the private space becomes public. How does this impact social relationships?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Casual encounters are just as important to belonging and trust as contact with family and friends.”</strong> (p134). <em>I guess this is why I go in to work every day.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">According to a survey by the Vancouver Foundation, <strong>“people living in towers consistently reported feeling more lonely and less connected than people living in detached homes.”</strong> (p135). This is likely because the design of towers does not facilitate natural social interaction.
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Almost all of us will choose a seat in a restaurant with a view of others. People will show up for the most mundane small-town parades. We like to look at each other. We enjoy hovering in the zone somewhere between strangers and intimates. We want the opportunity to watch and be watched, even if we have no intention of ever actually making contact with each other.”</strong> (p152). <em>There is no pleasure like existing in the world.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Modern cities and affluent economies have created a [articular kind of social deficit. We can meet almost all our needs without gathering in public. Technology and prosperity have largely privatized the realms of exchange in malls, living rooms, backyard and on the screens of computers and smartphones. We can enjoy the cinema without leaving bed. We can build new friendships without regard for geography. We tweet out gossip or argue on Facebook walls. We peruse and interview prospective love interests online. We have gotten so good at privatizing our comforts, out leisure time, and our communication that urban life gets scoured of time with people who are not already colleagues, family or close friends. Tellingly, the word ‘community’ is increasingly used to refer to groups of people who use the same media or who happen to like a certain product, regardless of whether its members have actually met. As more and more of us live alone, these conveniences have helped produce a historically unique way of living, in which home is not so much a gathering place as a vortex of isolation.”</strong> (p154). <em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It’s instant gratification for connection but it doesn’t last. Convenience is not worth social isolation and lack of belonging.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that the amount of traffic on a street impacts the social connections people form. <strong>“On a street with light traffic (two-thousand cars per day), children played on the sidewalks and street, people socialized on their front steps, and everyone reported having a tight web of contacts with neighbors on both sides of the street. On a nearly identical street with eight thousand cars passing per day, there was a dramatic drop in social activity and friendships. Another street with sixteen thousand cars saw almost nothing happening in the public realm, and social ties were few and far between.”</strong> (p168). <em>How did we do this to ourselves?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Most of the noise, air pollution, danger, and perceived crowding in modern cities occurs because we have configured urban spaces to facilitate high-speed travel in private automobiles. We have traded conviviality for the convenience of those who wish to experience the streets as briefly as possible. This is deeply unfair to people who live in central cities, for whom streets function as the soft social space between their destinations.”</strong> (p170). <em>But I can’t even say cars shouldn’t exist because there’s such a rush from driving fast. Beholden to fleeting pleasures at the cost of fulfillment.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Robert Burton’s The Anatomy of Melancholy, <strong>“the heavens themselves run continually round, the sun riseth and sets, the moon increaseth and decreased, stars and planets keep their constant motions, the air is still tossed by winds, the waters ebb and flow, to their conservation no doubt, to teach us that we should ever be in motion.”</strong> (p176). <em>Stability is a myth? We crave control but it's actually not good for us.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“For many, the commute really is a kind of heroic quest.”</strong> (p178). <em>It’s kind of nice when things are not easy and you have to abide by a schedule and be cold or uncomfortable and patient. Without things to hit against you become a blob that cannot handle anything.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Buckminster Fuller, <strong>“possession is becoming progressively burdensome and wasteful and therefore obsolete”</strong> (p178). <em>Sometimes I wish I possessed nothing in the pursuit of a clear conscience.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains evidence that driving on a clear road makes people feel more in control of their lives, and creates a biochemical response (‘rush’), especially in young men. (p179). However, driving in traffic increases cortisol and adrenaline. He notes, <strong>“it can take as much as an hour to recover the ability to concentrate after a long urban commute.”</strong> (p180). Chronic exposure to traffic leads to illness and premature death due to the stress hormones it promotes.
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“A city is really just the sum of what people think about it. The city is a subjective thing.”</strong> (p249). <em>We create our reality.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery cites Walter Benjamin, <strong>“the rigid isolated object… is of no use whatsoever. It must be inserted into the context of living social relations.”</strong> (p251). <em>Being too uptight is limiting, have no form and you belong anywhere.</em>


                </p>

                <p class="copy">In a discussion of environmental impact of cities, Montgomery explains a Danish garbage incineration plant wrapped in an artificial ski slope. <strong>“If guilt and shame and fear do not lead us to action, how can we hope to solve the urgent ecological challenges of our time? Ingles [the architect] offers a utopian response in the monumental form of his smoke-ring-blowing ski hill: with creative design, the sustainable life can actually be more pleasurable.” (p252). The architect called this “hedonistic sustainability.”</strong> (p252). <em>This is dystopian. Why do we need an immediate pleasure incentive to save ourselves from extinction? If the future of all life on Earth is not enough of a motivator maybe we deserve to be extinct.</em>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“Interventions to make walking and cycling sade and comfortable are radically more effective at bringing down emissions than the technological fixes being pushed by the transportation industry. This is because every journey we make burns some form of energy–usually some form of fossil fuel–and there is an inverse relationship between the carbon we burn in our machines and the food calories we burn when choosing how to get around.”</strong> (p257). <em>What about the carbon burned to produce and transport the food? Also, if the solution isn’t another product to buy, society might collapse.</em>

The machine can only get so big before ripping itself apart.</em>

                <p class="copy">In a discussion of the restrictive control of building code Montgomery explains, <strong>“code appears to be neutral, but it isn’t. However neutral the language is, however neutral the metrics, however fair it seems to be, the outcome it has in mind is sprawl.”</strong> (p281). <em>So we’re trapped. I guess sprawl is bad for us but good for business. What can we really do to fix this?</em>
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains an attempt to create a ‘village-like’ environment in Mableton, Atlanta, based on Disneyland’s Main Street USA that <strong>“refused to consider adding buildings that might obscure the view”</strong> (p291) of it’s picturesque buildings. The result was that there was no grocery store within walking distance, forcing its residents to drive for their essentials. <strong>In a common replaying of the focusing illusion, they chose the salience of form over function. They chose a design that felt like a village but did not actually perform like one.”</strong> (p291). <em>Function is most important, aesthetics are a bonus, but the most beautiful things are those that correspond to behaviour.</em>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery notes architect-philosopher Christopher Alexander’s <strong>“quality without a name”</strong>, meaning the <strong>“sense of aliveness in the city, and in [oneself].”</strong> (p303). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy">Montgomery explains that villages are typically arranged in concentric and overlapping circles, allowing frequent common places. In contrast, <strong>“the orthogonal road grid that [defines]... most American cities really is a hand-me-down from empires who used streets as tools of aggression.”</strong> (p304). 
                </p>

                <p class="copy"><strong>“People who live in sprawl are among the least likely of Americans to volunteer, vote, join political parties, or rise up and raise hell. There are many reasons for this apathy; not least among them might be genuine contentment. But the fact is, it’s hard to find the agora in the dispersed city. You can’t hold a demonstration in a Walmart parking lot or inside a Starbucks. Scant few neighborhoods in North America feature places that draw people together regularly for anything other than buying stuff.”</strong> (p306). <em>Engineering space to maintain complacency and the worship of material goods. All your time taken up by a long commute, working, buying groceries, decorating and maintaining a house. There is no time to look outwards from the personal bubble and contribute to the broader good.</em>
